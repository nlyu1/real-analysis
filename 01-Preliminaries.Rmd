:::{.proposition #closedSubsetCompact}
A closed subset $A\subset K$ where $K$ is compact, is compact. 
:::
_Proof:_ $V=K-A$ is open 
(if $K$ is a subset, then in the subsace topology), then 
for any $\{U_j\}$ covering $A$, $\{U_j\}\cup \{V\}$ will 
cover $K$. Choose a finite subcover and remove $V$ to obtain 
a finite subcover for $A$. 

:::{.proposition #compactHausdorffClosed}
A compact subset $K$ of a Hausdorff space $\Omega$ is closed. 
:::
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>
We show that $\Omega-K$ is open: for each $y\in \Omega-K$, 
use Hausdorff to construct a open covering $\{(U_x, V_x)\}_{x\in K}$ 
separating $x, y$ such that $x\in U_x, y\in V_y$. 
Choose a finite subset of $(U_x)_{x\in J\subsetneq K}$ covering $K$, 
then $y\in \bigcap_{x\in J} V_x \subset \Omega-K$, so $\Omega-K$ is open.

:::{.proposition #closedBoundedCompact name="closed+bounded=compact"}
For $\R^d$, a set $A$ is compact if and only if it is 
closed and bounded. 
:::
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>
Given compactness, choose a cover by unit-cube coverings, 
then $A\subset [-R, R]^n$, which is bounded. Closure follows 
from proposition \@ref(prp:compactHausdorffClosed). 
Conversely, given $A\subset [-R, R]^n$ and closed, it is 
a closed subset of a compact set, so it is compact by proposition 
\@ref(prp:closedSubsetCompact)

:::{.lemma #compactClosedDistance name="finite distance between compact and closed sets"}
If $F$ is closed and $K$ compact, and $F\cap K = \emptyset$, then 
$d(F, K)>0$. 
:::
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>
By $F^c$ open for each $x\in K$ choose $B(2\delta_x, x)\subset F^c$. 
Choose an finite open subcover $\{B_{\delta_x, x}\}_{x\in [n]}$ of $K$, then 
$d(F, K) > \min_{x\in [n]} \delta_x$.

:::{.proposition name="compactness and product"}
$\Omega, Y$ compact implies $\Omega\times Y$ compact. 
:::

:::{.lemma #distanceContinuity name="continuity of distance"}
Given a metric space $(\Omega, d)$ and a subset $Y\subset \Omega$, 
the function $\varphi:\Omega\to \R$ defined below is continuous: 
\[ 
    \varphi(x) = \inf_{y\in Y} d(x, y) 
\] 
:::
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>
The preimage operation commutes with arbitrary 
union and intersections, so it suffices to demonstrate this 
for open intervals $\{(0, a)\}\cup \{(b, \infty)\}$, to show that 
\[ 
    \varphi^{-1}((0, a)) = \{
        x\in \Omega: \forall \epsilon>0, 
        \exists y\in Y: d(x, y) < a+\epsilon
    \}
\] 
is open, similarly for the other subbasis component. Standard 
argument is omitted. 
</details>

:::{.lemma name="Lebesgue number lemma"}
Given a compact metric space $(\Omega, d)$ and an open cover $(U_j)$ 
of $\Omega$, there $\exists\delta>0$ such that any subset of diameter $<\delta$ 
is entirely contained in a single open set. 
:::
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>
Select a finite subcover $U_1\cup \cdots \cup U_n$ of 
$\Omega$. The function 
\[ 
    f(x) = \min_j d(x, \Omega-U_j)
\] 
is continuous on compact interval, thus achieves its min $\delta$. 
</details>

:::{.definition name="connected sets"}
A space $\Omega$ is connected if any of the following equivalent conditions 
are true: 

- Every binary partition $U\sqcup V=\Omega$ of $\Omega$ is trivial: $U$ or $V=\emptyset$ 
    and the other $\Omega$.
- The only subsets which are both open and closed in $\Omega$ is $\emptyset, \Omega$.

## Real analysis {-}

:::{.definition name="limit inferior"}
Given a countable sequence of reals $(a_j)$, the limit inferior is 
\[ 
    \liminf_{n\to \infty} a_n = \lim_{n\to \infty} g_n, \quad 
    g_n = \inf_{k\geq n} a_k 
\] 
The counterpart $\limsup$ is defined similarly. 
:::

:::{.definition name="Riemann integral"}
Fix $[a, b]$ and a partition $a=x_0\leq \cdots \leq x_n =b$, 
define $\Delta x_j = x_j - x_{j-1}$ and 
\begin{align}
    M_j &= \sup f([x_{j-1} \leq x\leq x_j]), \quad 
    m_j = \inf f([x_{j-1} \leq x\leq x_j]) \\ 
    U(P, f) &= \sum_{j=1}^n M_j \Delta x_j, \quad 
    L(P, f) = \sum_{j=1}^n m_j \Delta x_j 
\end{align}
The upper and lower integrals are defined as 
\begin{align}
    \bar{\int}^b_a f\, d\alpha = \inf U(P, f, \alpha), \quad 
    \underline{\int}^b_a f\, d\alpha = \sup L(P, f, \alpha)
\end{align}
:::

:::{.definition name="semi-continuity"}
A real-valued function $f$ is **lower-semicontinuous** 
if 
\[ 
    f^{-1}((t, \infty)) \text{ is open }\forall t
\] 
It is **upper-semicontinuous** when 
$f^{-1}((-\infty, t))$ is open for all $t$. 
:::

:::{.proposition name="equivalent characterization"}
$f:\Omega\to \R$ is lower semi-continuous 
iff any of the following holds for all $x$: 

1. Sequential characterization: 
    $x_n\to x \implies f(x)\leq \liminf f(x_n)$. 
2. Epsilon-delta characterization: 
$\forall \epsilon>0, \exists \delta>0: 
    f(B_\delta(x))>f(x)-\epsilon$. 

The corresponding characterizations of lower-continuity are: 

1. $x_n\to x \implies f(x)$ 
2. $\forall \epsilon>0, \exists \delta>0: 
    f(B_\delta(x)) < f(x)+\epsilon$.
