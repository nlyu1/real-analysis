# Measures and σ-algebra {#abstractMachinery}

This section develops the abstract machinery of measures and $\sigma$-algebras: 

1. [Definitions](#sigmaDefinition) of $\sigma$-algebra and monotone class theorem. 
2. [Measure spaces and measurable functions](#measurableSpaceFunctions): 
    $\sigma$-finite measures, measures of nested intersections or unions; 
    sufficient conditions for measurable functions; uniqueness of $\sigma$-finite 
    measures (a prime demonstration of the monotone class theorem); 
    product $\sigma$-algebras and measures. 
3. [Carathéodory measurability](#caratheodory): constructing 
    a measure by restricting an outer measure. 

Key takeaways: 

1. A measure space specifies the well-behaved, measurable 
    sets ($\sigma$-algebra), together with a function (called measure) which assigns a measure value 
    to each measurable set. The key desired property of a measure is 
    countable additivity under disjoint unions.
2. The preimage-operation commutes with all closure operations
    of the $\sigma$-algebra. 
3. Monotone class theorem \@ref(thm:monotoneClassTheorem): 
    the monotone class freely generated by an algebra of sets is also its 
    freely-generated $\sigma$-algebra. 
4. The product algebra $\Sigma_1\times \Sigma_2$ is universal and satisfies 
    the section property (proposition \@ref(prp:productSection)). 
5. General method of constructing measures: restricted finite additive measure $\to$ 
    unrestricted countably subadditive (outer) measure $\to$ 
    restricted countably additive measure. 
6. Measurable sets by the Carathéodory criteria 
    (definition \@ref(def:caratheodoryCriteria)) are closed under 
    $\sigma$-algebra operations. 


## σ-algebra {#sigmaDefinition -}

:::{.definition #setAlgebra name="algebra of sets"}
A collection $\mca A$ of sets is an algebra 
of sets if it is closed under finite union and 
differences: 
\[ 
    A, B\in \mca A\implies A\cup B, A-B, B-A\in \mca A 
\] 
:::

:::{.definition name="σ-algebra"}
Given a set $\Omega$, $\Sigma\subset 2^\Omega$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega$ if: 

1. $\emptyset\in \Sigma$. 
2. Closure under complement: $E\in \Sigma\implies \Omega-E\in \Sigma$. 
3. Closure under countable union: 
    $\{E_j\}\in \Sigma\implies \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty E_k \in \Sigma$. 
:::

:::{.proposition name="derived properties of σ-algebras"}
Given a $\sigma$-algebra $\Sigma$ on $\Omega$, then 

1. $\Omega\in \Sigma$. 
2. Closure under finite union, intersection, and difference: 
\[ 
    D, E\in \Sigma\implies D\cup E, D\cap E, D-E\in \Sigma 
\] 
3. $E_1, \cdots\in \Sigma\implies \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty E_k \in \Sigma$
:::
_Proof:_ (1) follows from $\Omega=\Omega-\emptyset$. 
(2) follows from $D\cap E = (\Omega-D)\cup (\Omega_E)$ and $D-E=(D\cap E)\cup E$. 
(3) follows from $\bigcap_{k=1}^\infty E_k = \Omega - \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty (\Omega-E_k)$.

<summary>Examples and remark</summary>

:::{.example}
Given any set $\Omega$, both $\{\emptyset, \Omega\}$ and $2^\Omega$ are $\sigma$-algebras 
on $\Omega$. The set of all subsets $E$ such that $E$ 
is countable or $\Omega-E$ countable is a $\sigma$-algebra (countable 
union of countable set is countable, else if one element's complement 
is countable, then the union's complement is countable, too). 
:::

:::{.remark}
A $\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega$ is a subset of $2^\Omega$ that contains $\emptyset$ 
and is closed under countable union. Compare to a topology on $\Omega$, which 
is a subset of $2^\Omega$ that contains $\emptyset, \Omega$, and is closed under 
arbitrary unions and finite intersections.

:::{.definition name="measurable space, measurable set"}
A measurable space is a pair $(\Omega, \Sigma)$ where $\Sigma$ is a $\sigma$-algebra 
on $\Omega$. 
A subset $S\subset \Omega$ is $\Sigma$-measurable iff $S\in \Sigma$. 
:::

:::{.definition name="freely generated σ-algebra"}
Given a set $\Omega$ and $\mca A\subset 2^\Omega$, the intersection 
of all $\sigma$-algebras $\Sigma$ on $\Omega$ such that 
$\mca A\subset \Sigma$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega$. 

In other words, every subset $A\subset 2^\Omega$ freely generates 
a $\sigma$-algebra $\sigma_{\mrm{Alg}}(A)$ on $\Omega$.
:::

:::{.definition name="monotone class"}
A monotone class $\mca M$ is a set of sets with the following 
properties: 
\begin{align}
    A_1, \cdots \in \mca M, \quad A_j\nearrow A &\implies A\in \mca M \\ 
    A_1, \cdots \in \mca M, \quad A_j\searrow A &\implies A\in \mca M

:::{.theorem #monotoneClassTheorem name="monotone class theorem"}
Given a set $\Omega$ and an algebra (definition \@ref(def:setAlgebra)) $\mca A$ 
of subsets of $\Omega$ such that $\Omega, \emptyset\in \mca A$. 
The smallest monotone class $\mca M\supset \mca A$ is $\sigma_{\mrm{Alg}}(\mca A)$. 
:::
<span style="color:green">
Proof idea: every $\sigma$-algebra is trivially a monotone class. 
Monotone class and closure under finite union and complement implies $\sigma$-algebra. 
Show that $\mca M$ is closed under finite union and complements. 
</span>
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>
If a monotone class $\mca M\supset \mca A$ 
is closed under complement and finite unions, 
then for any $A_1, \cdots\in \mca A$, the sequence of partial unions 
approaches the countable union in limit: 
\[ 
    \left(B_j = \bigcup_{k=1}^j A_j \in \mca M\right) \nearrow
    \bigcup_{j=1}^\infty A_j \in \mca M 
\] 
Together with complements, this shows that that 
$\mca M$ is a $\sigma$-algebra. To show that $\mca M$ 
is indeed closed under complement and finite union, argue for 
every set $A\in \mca M$ that the set $C(A)$ of all sets which 
stay within $\mca M$ under union is a 
monotone class: 
\[ 
    A\cup \bigcup_{j=1}^\infty B_j = \bigcup_{j=1}^\infty A\cup B \in \mca M
\] 
By the algebraic property of $\mca A$ we have 
$\mca A\subset C(A) =\mca M$ (this step requires the minimality of $\mca M$!). 
This shows that $\mca M$ is 
closed under complement and finite union, 
hence is a $\Sigma$-algebra.

:::{.corollary} 
Given an algebra of sets, its freely generated monotone class 
(smallest monotone class containing it) is also its freely generated 
$\sigma$-algebra.

Given a measurable space $(\Omega, \Sigma)$, a 
measure on $(\Omega, \Sigma)$ is a function 
$\mu:\Sigma\to [0, \infty]$ with

:::{.proposition name="measure of nested union"}
Under a measure space $(\Omega, \Sigma, \mu)$ with a nested 
chain $E_1\subset E_2\subset \cdots$, we have 
$\mu \bigcup_{j=1}^\infty E_j = \lim_{j\to \infty} \mu(E_j)$.  
:::
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>
Only consider the case $\mu(E_k) < \infty$ 
and define $E_0=\emptyset$, then 
$\bigcup_{j=1}^\infty E_j = \bigsqcup_{j=1}^\infty E_j - E_{j-1}$. 
Using the disjoint union additivity 
\begin{align}
    \bigcup_{j=1}^\infty E_j 
    &= \sum_{j=1}^\infty \mu(E_j - E_{j-1}) 
    = \lim_{k\to \infty} \sum_{j=1}^k \mu(E_j) - \mu(E_{j-1}) 
    = \lim_{k\to \infty} \mu(E_k)

Under a measure space $(\Omega, \Sigma, \mu)$ with a nested

:::{.definition #finiteMeasure name="finite and σ-finite measures"}
A measure space $(\Omega, \Sigma, \mu)$ is $\sigma$-finite 
if there are countably many sets $A_1, \cdots$ such that 
\[ 
    \mu(A_{\forall j}) < \infty, \quad \Omega = \bigcup_j A_j
\] 
with $\sigma$-finiteness, w.l.o.g. we can prove $A_j$ to be disjoint. 
The measure space is finite if $\mu(\Omega)<\infty$.

:::{.proposition name="composition preserves measurability"}
Given measurable $f:(\Omega, \Sigma)\to \R^n$ and $g:\R^n\to \R^m$ 
measurable, then $g\circ f$ is $\Sigma$-measurable.

We next prove a convenient criteria for proving measurability. 

:::{.proposition name="algebra of function preimages"}
The inverse image operation commutes with elementary algebraic operations: 
given $f:\Omega\to Y$, then 

1. $f^{-1}(Y-A) = \Omega - f^{-1}(A)$. 
2. $f^{-1}(\bigcup_{A\in \mca A} A) = \bigcup_{A\in \mca A} f^{-1}(A)$. 
3. $f^{-1}(\bigcap_{A\in \mca A} A) = \bigcap_{A\in \mca A} f^{-1}(A)$.

:::{.proposition name="condition for measurable function"}
Given measurable spaces $(\Omega_1, \Sigma_1), (\Omega_2, \Sigma_2)$, 
such that $\Sigma_2 = \sigma_{\mrm{Alg}}(\mca A)$. 
For every function $f:\Omega_1\to \Omega_2$ 
\[ 
    f^{-1}(\forall A\in \mca A) \in \Sigma_1 \implies 
    f \quad \Sigma_1\text{-measurable}. 
\] 
:::
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>
Consider the subsets 
whose preimage are measurable 
\[  
    \mca T = \{B\in \Sigma_2 | f^{-1}(B)\in \Sigma_1\} \supset \mca A
\] 
It suffices to show that $\Sigma_2 \subset \mca T$. 
To do so, we show that $\mca T$ is a $\sigma$-algebra 
by the well-behavior of set operations under preimage: 

- $\emptyset = f^{-1}(\emptyset) = \emptyset \in \Sigma_1,
    f^{-1}(\Omega_2) = \Omega_1\in \Sigma_1$. 
- For complement: given $B\in \mca T: f^{-1}(\Omega_2-B) = \Omega_1-f^{-1}(B) \in \Sigma_1$. 
- For countable union: 
    $\displaystyle f^{-1}\bigcup B_j = \bigcup f^{-1}B_j \in \Sigma_1$. 

The algebra of preimage commutes with all elementary set operations.

:::{.theorem #uniqueMeasure name="uniqueness of measures"}
Given $\Omega$ and $\Sigma = \sigma_{\mrm{Alg}}(\mca A)$, where $\mca A$ 
is a set algebra with $\Omega, \emptyset \in \mca A$. 
If $\mu_1$ is a $\sigma$-finite measure in the stronger sense such that 
\[ 
    \exists \{A_j\in \mca A\}_{i=1}^\infty, \quad \mu_1(A_j)<\infty, \quad 
    \bigcup_{j=1}^\infty A_j=\Omega 
\] 
Then every $\mu_2$ which coincides with $\mu_1$ on $\mca A$ 
satisfies $\mu_1=\mu_2$. 
:::
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>
First assume that $\mu_1(\Omega)<\infty$. Consider 
\[ 
    \mca M = \{A\in \Sigma: \mu_1(A) = \mu_2(A)\} \supset \mca A
\]  If this is shown to be a monotone class, then $\Sigma\subseteq \mca M$ 
(in fact it's equality by $A\in \Sigma$ condition). Given an 
increasing sequence of sets $A_j\subset \mca M$, construct 
$B_1 = A_1, B_{j>1} = A_j - A_{j-1}$, then 
\[ 
    \mu_1(A_{n\to \infty}) 
    = \mu_1 \bigsqcup_{j=1}^{n\to \infty} B_j 
    = \lim_{n\to \infty} \sum_{j=1}^n \mu_1(B_j) 
    = \lim_{n\to \infty} \mu_1(A_n) = \lim_{n\to \infty} \mu_2(A_n) 
    = \mu_2(A_{n\to \infty}) 
\] 
Additionally, $A\in \mca A\implies A^c\in \mca M$ since $\mu_j(A^c) = \mu_j(\Omega)-\mu_j(A)$
by $\mu_j$ finite, from which $\mca M$ is a monotone class. 
Next, for general $\sigma$-finite measures, $\mu_1(B\cap A_0) = \mu_2(B\cap A_0)$ for every 
$\mu(A_0)<\infty$ and $B\in \Sigma$ since $A_0\cap \Sigma = \sigma_{\mrm{Alg}}(A_0 \cap \mca A)$. 
By $\sigma$-finite assumption choose $\Omega = \bigsqcup A_j$ each with finite measure, then 
\[ 
    \mu_1(B\in \Sigma) = \mu_1 \bigsqcup_{j=1}^\infty A_j\cap B 
    = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \mu_1(A_j\cap B) 
    = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \mu_2(A_j\cap B) = \mu_2(B)

## Carathéodory measurability {#caratheodory -}

:::{.definition #defOuterMeasure name="outer measure"}
Given a set $\Omega$, a function $\mu:2^\Omega\to \R_{\geq 0}$

1. <u>non-negativity</u>: $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$. 
2. <u>monotonicity</u>: $A\subset B\implies \mu(A) \leq \mu(B)$.

:::

:::{.lemma #caratheodorySetAlgebra name="measurable sets form a set-algebra"}
The set $\Sigma\subset 2^\Omega$ of measurable sets is an algebra of sets 
that contains $\emptyset, \Omega$. 
:::
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>
We have $\emptyset, \Omega \in \Sigma$ 
by definition \@ref(def:caratheodoryCriteria) immediately. 
To show that $\Sigma$ is closed under countable intersection: 
given $A, B\in \Sigma$, applying the given condition on $(E, A), (\cdot, B)$ yields  
\begin{align}
    \mu(E) 
    &= \mu(E\cap A) + \mu(E\cap A^c)  \\ 
    &= \mu(E\cap A\cap B) + \mu(E\cap A\cap B^c) + \mu(E\cap A^c\cap B) 
    + \mu(E\cap A^c \cap B^c)
\end{align}
We wish to show that the RHS equals 
$\mu(E\cap A\cap B) + \mu(E\cap (A\cap B)^c)$. 
To this end, note that (using addition in place of union to reduce clutter): 
\begin{align}
    (A\cap B)^c &= A^c\cap B + A\cap B^c + A^c\cap B^c \\ 
    \mu(E\cap (A\cap B)^c) &= \mu(E\cap (A\cap B)^c\cap A) + 
    \mu(E\cap (A\cap B)^c \cap A^c) \\ 
    &= \mu(E\cap A\cap B^c) + \mu(E\cap A^c\cap B + E\cap A^c\cap B^c) \\ 
    &= \mu(E\cap A\cap B^c) + \mu(E\cap A^c\cap B) + \mu(E\cap A^c\cap B^c) \\ 
\end{align}

The following lemmas each depend on the previous one and culminates in the 
Carathéodory theorem. 

:::{.lemma name="countable additivity on measurable sets"}
Given disjoint sets $B_1, \cdots \in \Sigma$: 
\[ 
    \mu \left(
        E\cap \bigsqcup_{j=1}^\infty B_j 
    \right) = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \mu(E\cap B_j)
\] 
In particular, $\mu$ is countable additive on $\Sigma$ by setting $E=\Omega$: 
\[ 
    \mu \bigsqcup_{j=1}^\infty (B_j\in \Sigma) = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \mu(B_j) 
\] 
:::
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>
For disjoint $B_1, B_2\in \Sigma$, applying 
definition \@ref(def:caratheodoryCriteria) yields 
$\mu(B_1\sqcup B_2) = \mu(B_1) + \mu(B_2)$; finite additivity follows by induction. 
In particular, this implies the following limit 
since it holds for each $m$ 
\[ 
    \lim_{m\to \infty} \mu\left(
        E\cap \bigsqcup_{j=1}^m B_j 
    \right)
    = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \mu(E\cap B_j)
    (\#eq:caratheodoryLimit)
\] 
We next show countable additivity: given disjoint $B_1, \cdots$ 
\[ 
    \lim_{m\to \infty} \mu\left(
        E\cap \bigsqcup_{j=1}^m B_j 
    \right) \leq \mu \left(
        E\cap \bigsqcup_{j=1}^\infty B_j 
    \right) = \mu \left(\bigsqcup_{j=1}^\infty E\cap B_j\right) 
    \leq \sum_{j=1}^\infty \mu(E\cap B_j)
\] 
But the LHS and RHS are exactly those of equation \@ref(eq:caratheodoryLimit), so 
we obtain the equality by sandwich-ing 
\[ 
    \mu \left(
        E\cap \bigsqcup_{j=1}^\infty B_j 
    \right) = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \mu(E\cap B_j)
\]

:::{.lemma name="Carathéodory-measurable sets form a sigma-algebra"}
$\Sigma$ is a $\sigma$-algebra; equivalently 
in light of lemma \@ref(lem:caratheodorySetAlgebra), 
\[ 
    B_{\forall j}\in \Sigma\implies \bigcup_{j=1}^\infty B_j \in \Sigma 
\] 
:::
<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>
Without loss of generality assume $B_j$ distinct. 
One direction follows from countable subadditivity: 
\[ 
    \mu(E) = \mu((E\cap B)\cup (E\cap B^c)) \leq \mu(E\cap B) + \mu(E\cap B^c)
\] 
For the other direction, the following equation holds for each $m$ thus in limit 
\[ 
    \mu_E = \lim_{m\to \infty} \mu\left(E\cap \bigcup_{j=1}^m B_j \right) + \mu \left[
        E\cap \left(\bigcup_{j=1}^m B_j\right)^c
    \right]
    (\#eq:caratheodoryuni) 
\] 
The limit of the first term is known to be $\mu(E\cap B)$, the second term 
\[ 
    \mu \left[
        E\cap \left(\bigcup_{j=1}^m B_j\right)^c
    \right] \geq \mu(E\cap B^c) 
\] 
by subadditivity; substituting into equation \@ref(eq:caratheodoryuni)
completes the proof. 
\[ 
    \mu_E \geq \mu\left(E\cap \bigcup_{j=1}^\infty B_j \right) + \mu \left[
        E\cap \left(\bigcup_{j=1}^\infty B_j\right)^c
