[["index.html", "Measure Theory, Functional Analysis Preface Organization Main deliverables", " Measure Theory, Functional Analysis Nicholas Lyu 2024-10-26 Preface These notes accompany the Fall 2024 iteration of Math 114, a second-semester undergraduate course on real analysis and measure theory. These notes deviate quite a bit from lecture materials, in particular: I prefer a more principled construction of the Lebesgue measure as the restriction of the exterior measure using the Carathéodory theorem. Sets declared measurable by the Carathéodory criteria are automatically closed under \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra operations, so one only needs to show the measurability of rectangles to establish the measurability of the Borel sets. Materials are heavily supplemented by Sheldon Axler’s Measure, Integration and Real Analysis. Some time is spent on infinite-dimensional vector spaces and results in Banach spaces, since nontrivial complexities arive when we generalize linear algebra constructions to infinite-dimensions (e.g. Hammel basis, span, and orthonormal basis). several theorems are important for convex analysis. Much more time is spent on the Fourier transform, with intuitions developed on the compact domain \\(\\partial D\\cong S^1\\) and later generalized to locally compact abelian groups.

Main deliverables Monotone class theorem 2.1: freely-generated monotone class equals freely-generated \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra for algebra of sets containing \\(\\Omega\\). Carathéodory’s theorem 2.3: given an outer measure \\(\\mu\\), the measurable sets \\(B\\subset \\Omega\\) satisfying \\(\\mu(\\forall E) = \\mu(E\\cap B) + \\mu(E\\cap B^c)\\) form a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra and obey countable additivity. Dominated convergence theorem 4.8: dominated pointwise limit of measurable functions can be exchanged with integral. Hahn-Banach, hyperplane separation theorems: for every extension of a bounded linear functional, there exists a norm-minimizing one which preserves the original norm. Fubini’s theorem Baire’s theorem 6.4: for every cover of a complete metric space by closed sets, there exists an element with nonempty interior. Proof techniques: Working with countable collection of approximations: given tolerance \\(\\epsilon\\), introduce approximation of index \\(j\\) with tolerance \\(\\epsilon 2^{-j}\\) to have additively bounded total tolerance. Examples: outer measure properties of exterior measure (proposition 3.1). Prove properties for characteristic functions, then generalize them using approximation and limit theorems here. Examples: Luzin’s theorem, monotone convergence theorem 4.7, Sandwich bounds Lemma 2.2, Monotone convergence theorem. Argue the convergence of a subsequence satisfying \\(\\sum |f_k - f_{k-1}|&lt;\\infty\\) when working with Cauchy sequences. Baire’s theorem 6.4. Completeness proof for \\(L^p\\) (proposition 7.7). Prime example for the use of monotone convergence theorem, Fatou’s lemma, and dominated convergence theorem: proposition 7.7. Using the monotone class theorem (example theorem 2.2): rewrite nested chain as disjoint union, then pass through the limit using the countable additivity of measures. Next apply the reduction from finite to \\(\\sigma\\)-finite measures. Demonstrating a certain property (e.g. triviality): approximate by a tractable dense subset. Orthonormality of the Fourier basis on \\(L^2(\\partial D)\\) (proposition 8.7). Mandatory todo list: Inductive generalization of Holder’s inequality. Put in some pset problems. Pset problem: separately continuous implies measurable. Dual of \\(L^p\\) space. Optional: Lieb and Loss 2.9 to 2.18: compactness under weak convergence. Product measures and Fubini. Arnold-Kolmorogorov theorem. Bibliography "],["prelimaries.html", "1 Prelimaries Topology Real analysis", " 1 Prelimaries This section is a dump of various preliminary results for reference. Please see the next section for the main content of the course. Topology First recall some topological definitions: The norm \\(|x|\\) of \\(x\\) equals \\((\\sum x_j^2)^{1/2}\\). The distance between two points is is \\(|x-y|\\). The distance between two sets is \\(d(E, F)=\\inf_{x\\in E, y\\in F}|x-y|\\). A set \\(E\\) is bounded if it is contained in some ball of finite radius. A bounded set is compact if it is also closed. A point \\(x\\) is a limit point of the set \\(E\\) if \\(\\forall r&gt;0, B_r(x)\\cap E\\neq \\emptyset\\). \\(x\\in E\\) is isolated if \\(\\exists r&gt;0: B_r(x)\\cap E=\\{x\\}\\). \\(x\\in E\\) is an interior point if \\(\\exists r&gt;0: B_r(x)\\subset E\\); the interior points of \\(E\\) is denoted \\(\\mathrm{Int}(E)\\). The boundary \\(\\partial E = \\bar E - \\mathrm{Int}(E)\\). A closed set \\(E\\) is perfect if it does not have any isolated points. Proposition 1.1 A closed subset \\(A\\subset K\\) where \\(K\\) is compact, is compact. Proof: \\(V=K-A\\) is open (if \\(K\\) is a subset, then in the subsace topology), then for any \\(\\{U_j\\}\\) covering \\(A\\), \\(\\{U_j\\}\\cup \\{V\\}\\) will cover \\(K\\). Choose a finite subcover and remove \\(V\\) to obtain a finite subcover for \\(A\\). Proposition 1.2 A compact subset \\(K\\) of a Hausdorff space \\(\\Omega\\) is closed. Proof We show that \\(\\Omega-K\\) is open: for each \\(y\\in \\Omega-K\\), use Hausdorff to construct a open covering \\(\\{(U_x, V_x)\\}_{x\\in K}\\) separating \\(x, y\\) such that \\(x\\in U_x, y\\in V_y\\). Choose a finite subset of \\((U_x)_{x\\in J\\subsetneq K}\\) covering \\(K\\), then \\(y\\in \\bigcap_{x\\in J} V_x \\subset \\Omega-K\\), so \\(\\Omega-K\\) is open. Proposition 1.3 (closed+bounded=compact) For \\(\\mathbb R^d\\), a set \\(A\\) is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. Proof Given compactness, choose a cover by unit-cube coverings, then \\(A\\subset [-R, R]^n\\), which is bounded. Closure follows from proposition 1.2. Conversely, given \\(A\\subset [-R, R]^n\\) and closed, it is a closed subset of a compact set, so it is compact by proposition 1.1 Lemma 1.1 (finite distance between compact and closed sets) If \\(F\\) is closed and \\(K\\) compact, and \\(F\\cap K = \\emptyset\\), then \\(d(F, K)&gt;0\\). Proof By \\(F^c\\) open for each \\(x\\in K\\) choose \\(B(2\\delta_x, x)\\subset F^c\\). Choose an finite open subcover \\(\\{B_{\\delta_x, x}\\}_{x\\in [n]}\\) of \\(K\\), then \\(d(F, K) &gt; \\min_{x\\in [n]} \\delta_x\\). Proposition 1.4 (compactness and product) \\(\\Omega, Y\\) compact implies \\(\\Omega\\times Y\\) compact. Lemma 1.2 (continuity of distance) Given a metric space \\((\\Omega, d)\\) and a subset \\(Y\\subset \\Omega\\), the function \\(\\varphi:\\Omega\\to \\mathbb R\\) defined below is continuous: \\[ \\varphi(x) = \\inf_{y\\in Y} d(x, y) \\] Proof The preimage operation commutes with arbitrary union and intersections, so it suffices to demonstrate this for open intervals \\(\\{(0, a)\\}\\cup \\{(b, \\infty)\\}\\), to show that \\[ \\varphi^{-1}((0, a)) = \\{ x\\in \\Omega: \\forall \\epsilon&gt;0, \\exists y\\in Y: d(x, y) &lt; a+\\epsilon \\} \\] is open, similarly for the other subbasis component. Standard argument is omitted. Lemma 1.3 (Lebesgue number lemma) Given a compact metric space \\((\\Omega, d)\\) and an open cover \\((U_j)\\) of \\(\\Omega\\), there \\(\\exists\\delta&gt;0\\) such that any subset of diameter \\(&lt;\\delta\\) is entirely contained in a single open set. Proof Select a finite subcover \\(U_1\\cup \\cdots \\cup U_n\\) of \\(\\Omega\\). The function \\[ f(x) = \\min_j d(x, \\Omega-U_j) \\] is continuous on compact interval, thus achieves its min \\(\\delta\\). Definition 1.1 (connected sets) A space \\(\\Omega\\) is connected if any of the following equivalent conditions are true: Every binary partition \\(U\\sqcup V=\\Omega\\) of \\(\\Omega\\) is trivial: \\(U\\) or \\(V=\\emptyset\\) and the other \\(\\Omega\\). The only subsets which are both open and closed in \\(\\Omega\\) is \\(\\emptyset, \\Omega\\). Real analysis Definition 1.2 (Riemann integral) Fix \\([a, b]\\) and a partition \\(a=x_0\\leq \\cdots \\leq x_n =b\\), define \\(\\Delta x_j = x_j - x_{j-1}\\) and \\[\\begin{align} M_j &amp;= \\sup f([x_{j-1} \\leq x\\leq x_j]), \\quad m_j = \\inf f([x_{j-1} \\leq x\\leq x_j]) \\\\ U(P, f) &amp;= \\sum_{j=1}^n M_j \\Delta x_j, \\quad L(P, f) = \\sum_{j=1}^n m_j \\Delta x_j \\end{align}\\] The upper and lower integrals are defined as \\[\\begin{align} \\bar{\\int}^b_a f\\, d\\alpha = \\inf U(P, f, \\alpha), \\quad \\underline{\\int}^b_a f\\, d\\alpha = \\sup L(P, f, \\alpha) \\end{align}\\] Semi-continuity Definition 1.3 (limit inferior) Given a countable sequence of reals \\((a_j)\\), the limit inferior is \\[ \\liminf_{n\\to \\infty} a_n = \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} g_n, \\quad g_n = \\inf_{k\\geq n} a_k \\] The counterpart \\(\\limsup\\) is defined similarly. Definition 1.4 (semi-continuity) A \\(\\mathbb R^n\\)-valued function \\(f\\) is lower-semicontinuous if \\[ f^{-1}((t, \\infty)) \\text{ is open }\\forall t \\] It is upper-semicontinuous when \\(f^{-1}((-\\infty, t))\\) is open for all \\(t\\). Here \\((t, \\infty)\\) denotes the set of all vectors which larger than \\(t\\) pointwise. Proposition 1.5 (ε-δ definition of semi-continuity) Given a metric space \\(X\\), \\(f:X\\to \\mathbb R^n\\) is lower semicontinuous at \\(x_0\\in X\\) if for every vector \\(\\epsilon&gt;0\\) there exists a real scalar \\(\\delta&gt;0\\) such that \\[ f(B_\\delta(x_0)) \\geq f(x_0) - \\epsilon \\] Similarly, it is upper-semicontinuous when \\(f(B_\\delta(x_0)) \\leq f(x_0) + \\epsilon\\). Proof: We do the proof for lower-semicontinuity. Assuming definition 1.4, \\(f^{-1}((t-\\epsilon, \\infty))\\) open for every \\(\\epsilon\\) implies that at \\(x_0\\in f^{-1}(t-\\epsilon, \\infty)\\) has an open neighborhood. Conversely, assuming the given condition holds at every \\(x_0\\in X\\), the preimage of every open set \\(f^{-1}((t, \\infty))\\) contains an open neighborhood for each point thus is open. Proposition 1.6 (limit definition of semi-continuity) \\(f:X\\to \\mathbb R^n\\) is lower semicontinuous at \\(x_0\\) if \\[ \\liminf_{x\\to x_0} f(x) \\geq f(x_0) \\] Similarly, it is upper-continuous at \\(x_0\\) if \\(\\limsup_{x\\to x_0} f(x) \\leq f(x_0)\\). Proof: \\(\\liminf_{x\\to x_0} f(x) \\geq f(x_0)\\) implies that \\(\\forall \\epsilon&gt;0\\in \\mathbb R^n\\), there exists \\(\\delta &gt; 0 \\in \\mathbb R\\) such that \\(f(B_\\delta(x_0))\\geq f(x_0) - \\epsilon\\). Similarly, \\(\\limsup_{x\\to x_0} f(x) \\leq f(x_0)\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon&gt;0\\in \\mathbb R^n\\), there exists \\(\\delta&gt;0\\in \\mathbb R\\) such that \\(f(B_\\delta(x_0)) \\leq f(x_0) + \\epsilon\\). Example 1.1 Of the following, \\(f_1, f_4\\) is lower but not upper semi-continuous, \\(f_2, f_3\\) is upper but not lower semi-continuous. is \\[ f_1(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 &amp; x\\leq 0 \\\\ 1 &amp; x &gt; 0 \\end{cases}, \\quad f_2(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 &amp; x &lt; 0 \\\\ 1 &amp; x \\geq 0 \\end{cases}, \\quad f_3(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 &amp; x \\leq 0 \\\\ -1 &amp; x &gt; 0 \\end{cases}, \\quad f_4(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 &amp; x &lt; 0 \\\\ -1 &amp; x \\geq 0 \\end{cases} \\] (Lower, upper) semi-continuous functions can only jump (down, up) in limit on the side with open iterval. Cauchy sequences Definition 1.5 (Cauchy sequence) A sequence \\(f_j\\) in a metric space \\((V, d)\\) is a Cauchy sequence if \\(\\forall \\epsilon&gt;0\\), there exists \\(n\\in \\mathbb Z_+\\) such that \\(d(f_{\\forall j\\geq N}, f_{\\forall k\\geq n})&lt;\\epsilon\\). Proposition 1.7 (convergent subsequence) Given a Cauchy sequence \\((f_j)\\), if some subsequence \\(f_{n_j}\\to f\\) converges, then the whole sequence \\(f_j\\to f\\) converges. Proof (sketch): Use the triangle inequality and convergence condition. "],["abstractMachinery.html", "2 Measures and σ-algebra σ-algebra Measure space Measurable function Carathéodory theorem", " 2 Measures and σ-algebra This section develops the abstract machinery of measures and \\(\\sigma\\)-algebras: Definitions of \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra, product \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra, and monotone class theorem. Measure spaces: \\(\\sigma\\)-finite measures, measures of nested intersections or unions; sufficient conditions for measurable functions; uniqueness of \\(\\sigma\\)-finite measures (a prime demonstration of the monotone class theorem). Measurable functions: composition establishing measurability using the generators of the \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra. Carathéodory theorem: constructing a measure by restricting an outer measure. Key takeaways: A measure space specifies the well-behaved, measurable sets (\\(\\sigma\\)-algebra), together with a function (called measure) which assigns a measure value to each measurable set. The key desired property of a measure is countable additivity under disjoint unions. Monotone class theorem 2.1: the monotone class freely generated by an algebra of sets is also its freely-generated \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra. The product algebra \\(\\Sigma_1\\times \\Sigma_2\\) is universal and satisfies the section property (proposition ??). The preimage-operation commutes with all closure operations of the \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra, the key properties of which is countability; to check measurability of a function it suffices to check the generators of the codomain \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra (proposition 2.6). General method of constructing measures: restricted finite additive measure \\(\\to\\) unrestricted countably subadditive (outer) measure \\(\\to\\) restricted countably additive measure. Measurable sets by the Carathéodory criteria (definition 2.10) are closed under \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra operations. To motivate the careful construction of a rigorous measure: We need more than finite additivity in order to exchange integrals and limits. Uncountable additivity is too strong: points have measure zero, but intervals should have nontrivial measure. There exists subsets of \\(\\mathbb R^n\\) which are too irregular to accomodate additivity, so we need the machinery of \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra to describe the measurable sets. σ-algebra Definition 2.1 (algebra of sets) A collection \\(\\mathcal A\\) of sets is an algebra of sets if it is closed under finite union and differences: \\[ A, B\\in \\mathcal A\\implies A\\cup B, A-B, B-A\\in \\mathcal A \\] Definition 2.2 (σ-algebra) Given a set \\(\\Omega\\), \\(\\Sigma\\subset 2^\\Omega\\) is a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra on \\(\\Omega\\) if: \\(\\emptyset\\in \\Sigma\\). Closure under complement: \\(E\\in \\Sigma\\implies \\Omega-E\\in \\Sigma\\). Closure under countable union: \\(\\{E_j\\}\\in \\Sigma\\implies \\bigcup_{k=1}^\\infty E_k \\in \\Sigma\\). Proposition 2.1 (derived properties of σ-algebras) Given a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra \\(\\Sigma\\) on \\(\\Omega\\), then \\(\\Omega\\in \\Sigma\\). Closure under finite union, intersection, and difference: \\[ D, E\\in \\Sigma\\implies D\\cup E, D\\cap E, D-E\\in \\Sigma \\] \\(E_1, \\cdots\\in \\Sigma\\implies \\bigcap_{k=1}^\\infty E_k \\in \\Sigma\\) Proof: (1) follows from \\(\\Omega=\\Omega-\\emptyset\\). (2) follows from \\(D\\cap E = (\\Omega-D)\\cup (\\Omega_E)\\) and \\(D-E=(D\\cap E)\\cup E\\). (3) follows from \\(\\bigcap_{k=1}^\\infty E_k = \\Omega - \\bigcup_{k=1}^\\infty (\\Omega-E_k)\\). Examples and remark Example 2.1 Given any set \\(\\Omega\\), both \\(\\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}\\) and \\(2^\\Omega\\) are \\(\\sigma\\)-algebras on \\(\\Omega\\). The set of all subsets \\(E\\) such that \\(E\\) is countable or \\(\\Omega-E\\) countable is a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra (countable union of countable set is countable, else if one element’s complement is countable, then the union’s complement is countable, too). Remark. A \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra on \\(\\Omega\\) is a subset of \\(2^\\Omega\\) that contains \\(\\emptyset\\) and is closed under countable union. Compare to a topology on \\(\\Omega\\), which is a subset of \\(2^\\Omega\\) that contains \\(\\emptyset, \\Omega\\), and is closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections. Definition 2.3 (measurable space, measurable set) A measurable space is a pair \\((\\Omega, \\Sigma)\\) where \\(\\Sigma\\) is a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra on \\(\\Omega\\). A subset \\(S\\subset \\Omega\\) is \\(\\Sigma\\)-measurable iff \\(S\\in \\Sigma\\). Definition 2.4 (freely generated σ-algebra) Given a set \\(\\Omega\\) and \\(\\mathcal A\\subset 2^\\Omega\\), the intersection of all \\(\\sigma\\)-algebras \\(\\Sigma\\) on \\(\\Omega\\) such that \\(\\mathcal A\\subset \\Sigma\\) is a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra on \\(\\Omega\\). In other words, every subset \\(A\\subset 2^\\Omega\\) freely generates a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra \\(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Alg}}(A)\\) on \\(\\Omega\\). Definition 2.5 (monotone class) A monotone class \\(\\mathcal M\\) is a set of sets with the following properties: \\[\\begin{align} A_1, \\cdots \\in \\mathcal M, \\quad A_j\\nearrow A &amp;\\implies A\\in \\mathcal M \\\\ A_1, \\cdots \\in \\mathcal M, \\quad A_j\\searrow A &amp;\\implies A\\in \\mathcal M \\end{align}\\] Theorem 2.1 (monotone class theorem) Given a set \\(\\Omega\\) and an algebra (definition 2.1) \\(\\mathcal A\\) of subsets of \\(\\Omega\\) such that \\(\\Omega, \\emptyset\\in \\mathcal A\\). The smallest monotone class \\(\\mathcal M\\supset \\mathcal A\\) is \\(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Alg}}(\\mathcal A)\\). Proof idea: every \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra is trivially a monotone class. Monotone class and closure under finite union and complement implies \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra. Show that \\(\\mathcal M\\) is closed under finite union and complements. Proof If a monotone class \\(\\mathcal M\\supset \\mathcal A\\) is closed under complement and finite unions, then for any \\(A_1, \\cdots\\in \\mathcal A\\), the sequence of partial unions approaches the countable union in limit: \\[ \\left(B_j = \\bigcup_{k=1}^j A_j \\in \\mathcal M\\right) \\nearrow \\bigcup_{j=1}^\\infty A_j \\in \\mathcal M \\] Together with complements, this shows that that \\(\\mathcal M\\) is a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra. To show that \\(\\mathcal M\\) is indeed closed under complement and finite union, argue for every set \\(A\\in \\mathcal M\\) that the set \\(C(A)\\) of all sets which stay within \\(\\mathcal M\\) under union is a monotone class: \\[ A\\cup \\bigcup_{j=1}^\\infty B_j = \\bigcup_{j=1}^\\infty A\\cup B \\in \\mathcal M \\] By the algebraic property of \\(\\mathcal A\\) we have \\(\\mathcal A\\subset C(A) =\\mathcal M\\) (this step requires the minimality of \\(\\mathcal M\\)!). This shows that \\(\\mathcal M\\) is closed under complement and finite union, hence is a \\(\\Sigma\\)-algebra. Definition 2.6 (product σ-algebra) The product \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra is the smallest \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra containing all rectangles. \\[ \\Sigma = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{Alg}}(\\Sigma_1\\times \\Sigma_2) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{Alg}}\\left(\\{ A_1\\times A_2 | A_1\\in \\Sigma_1, A_2\\in \\Sigma_2 \\}\\right) \\] where here \\(\\Sigma_1\\times \\Sigma_2\\) denotes the Cartesian product of sets. The product measure \\(\\mu = \\mu_1\\times \\mu_2\\) is Corollary 2.1 Given an algebra of sets, its freely generated monotone class (smallest monotone class containing it) is also its freely generated \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra. Measure space Definition 2.7 (measure, measure space) Given a measurable space \\((\\Omega, \\Sigma)\\), a measure on \\((\\Omega, \\Sigma)\\) is a function \\(\\mu:\\Sigma\\to [0, \\infty]\\) with \\[ \\mu \\left(\\bigsqcup_{k=1}^\\infty E_k\\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\mu(E_k), \\quad \\mu(\\emptyset) = 0 \\] for every disjoint sequence \\(\\{E_j\\} \\in \\Sigma\\). A measure space is an ordered triple \\((\\Omega, \\Sigma, \\mu)\\). Proposition 2.2 (elementary properties of measures) Given a measure space \\((\\Omega, \\Sigma, \\mu)\\) and \\(D\\subset E\\in \\Sigma\\): \\(\\mu(D) \\leq \\mu(E)\\). \\(\\mu(E - D) = \\mu(E) - \\mu(D)\\). Proposition 2.3 (measure of nested union) Under a measure space \\((\\Omega, \\Sigma, \\mu)\\) with a nested chain \\(E_1\\subset E_2\\subset \\cdots\\), we have \\(\\mu \\bigcup_{j=1}^\\infty E_j = \\lim_{j\\to \\infty} \\mu(E_j)\\). Proof Only consider the case \\(\\mu(E_k) &lt; \\infty\\) and define \\(E_0=\\emptyset\\), then \\(\\bigcup_{j=1}^\\infty E_j = \\bigsqcup_{j=1}^\\infty E_j - E_{j-1}\\). Using the disjoint union additivity \\[\\begin{align} \\bigcup_{j=1}^\\infty E_j &amp;= \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\mu(E_j - E_{j-1}) = \\lim_{k\\to \\infty} \\sum_{j=1}^k \\mu(E_j) - \\mu(E_{j-1}) = \\lim_{k\\to \\infty} \\mu(E_k) \\end{align}\\] The dual of the proposition above is given below. Corollary 2.2 (measure of nested intersection) Under a measure space \\((\\Omega, \\Sigma, \\mu)\\) with a nested chain \\(E_1\\supset E_2\\supset \\cdots\\), we have \\(\\mu \\bigcap_{j=1}^\\infty E_j = \\lim_{j\\to \\infty} \\mu(E_j)\\). Definition 2.8 (finite and σ-finite measures) A measure space \\((\\Omega, \\Sigma, \\mu)\\) is \\(\\sigma\\)-finite if there are countably many sets \\(A_1, \\cdots\\) such that \\[ \\mu(A_{\\forall j}) &lt; \\infty, \\quad \\Omega = \\bigcup_j A_j \\] with \\(\\sigma\\)-finiteness, w.l.o.g. we can prove \\(A_j\\) to be disjoint. The measure space is finite if \\(\\mu(\\Omega)&lt;\\infty\\). Theorem 2.2 (uniqueness of measures) Given \\(\\Omega\\) and \\(\\Sigma = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{Alg}}(\\mathcal A)\\), where \\(\\mathcal A\\) is a set algebra with \\(\\Omega, \\emptyset \\in \\mathcal A\\). If \\(\\mu_1\\) is a \\(\\sigma\\)-finite measure in the stronger sense such that \\[ \\exists \\{A_j\\in \\mathcal A\\}_{i=1}^\\infty, \\quad \\mu_1(A_j)&lt;\\infty, \\quad \\bigcup_{j=1}^\\infty A_j=\\Omega \\] Then every \\(\\mu_2\\) which coincides with \\(\\mu_1\\) on \\(\\mathcal A\\) satisfies \\(\\mu_1=\\mu_2\\). Proof First assume that \\(\\mu_1(\\Omega)&lt;\\infty\\). Consider \\[ \\mathcal M = \\{A\\in \\Sigma: \\mu_1(A) = \\mu_2(A)\\} \\supset \\mathcal A \\] If this is shown to be a monotone class, then \\(\\Sigma\\subseteq \\mathcal M\\) (in fact it’s equality by \\(A\\in \\Sigma\\) condition). Given an increasing sequence of sets \\(A_j\\subset \\mathcal M\\), construct \\(B_1 = A_1, B_{j&gt;1} = A_j - A_{j-1}\\), then \\[ \\mu_1(A_{n\\to \\infty}) = \\mu_1 \\bigsqcup_{j=1}^{n\\to \\infty} B_j = \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\sum_{j=1}^n \\mu_1(B_j) = \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\mu_1(A_n) = \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\mu_2(A_n) = \\mu_2(A_{n\\to \\infty}) \\] Additionally, \\(A\\in \\mathcal A\\implies A^c\\in \\mathcal M\\) since \\(\\mu_j(A^c) = \\mu_j(\\Omega)-\\mu_j(A)\\) by \\(\\mu_j\\) finite, from which \\(\\mathcal M\\) is a monotone class. Next, for general \\(\\sigma\\)-finite measures, \\(\\mu_1(B\\cap A_0) = \\mu_2(B\\cap A_0)\\) for every \\(\\mu(A_0)&lt;\\infty\\) and \\(B\\in \\Sigma\\) since \\(A_0\\cap \\Sigma = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{Alg}}(A_0 \\cap \\mathcal A)\\). By \\(\\sigma\\)-finite assumption choose \\(\\Omega = \\bigsqcup A_j\\) each with finite measure, then \\[ \\mu_1(B\\in \\Sigma) = \\mu_1 \\bigsqcup_{j=1}^\\infty A_j\\cap B = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\mu_1(A_j\\cap B) = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\mu_2(A_j\\cap B) = \\mu_2(B) \\] Measurable function Proposition 2.4 (composition preserves measurability) Given a measurable chain \\[ (\\Omega_1, \\Sigma_1)\\xrightarrow f (\\Omega_2, \\Sigma_2) \\xrightarrow g (\\Omega_3, \\Sigma_3) \\] then \\(g\\circ f\\) is \\(\\Sigma_1\\)-measurable. We next prove a convenient criteria for proving measurability. Proposition 2.5 (algebra of function preimages) The inverse image operation commutes with elementary algebraic operations: given \\(f:\\Omega\\to Y\\), then \\(f^{-1}(Y-A) = \\Omega - f^{-1}(A)\\). \\(f^{-1}(\\bigcup_{A\\in \\mathcal A} A) = \\bigcup_{A\\in \\mathcal A} f^{-1}(A)\\). \\(f^{-1}(\\bigcap_{A\\in \\mathcal A} A) = \\bigcap_{A\\in \\mathcal A} f^{-1}(A)\\). Proposition 2.6 (condition for measurable function) Given measurable spaces \\((\\Omega_1, \\Sigma_1), (\\Omega_2, \\Sigma_2)\\), such that \\(\\Sigma_2 = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{Alg}}(\\mathcal A)\\). For every function \\(f:\\Omega_1\\to \\Omega_2\\) \\[ f^{-1}(\\forall A\\in \\mathcal A) \\in \\Sigma_1 \\implies f \\quad \\Sigma_1\\text{-measurable}. \\] Proof Consider the subsets whose preimage are measurable \\[ \\mathcal T = \\{B\\in \\Sigma_2 | f^{-1}(B)\\in \\Sigma_1\\} \\supset \\mathcal A \\] It suffices to show that \\(\\Sigma_2 \\subset \\mathcal T\\). To do so, we show that \\(\\mathcal T\\) is a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra by the well-behavior of set operations under preimage: \\(\\emptyset = f^{-1}(\\emptyset) = \\emptyset \\in \\Sigma_1, f^{-1}(\\Omega_2) = \\Omega_1\\in \\Sigma_1\\). For complement: given \\(B\\in \\mathcal T: f^{-1}(\\Omega_2-B) = \\Omega_1-f^{-1}(B) \\in \\Sigma_1\\). For countable union: \\(\\displaystyle f^{-1}\\bigcup B_j = \\bigcup f^{-1}B_j \\in \\Sigma_1\\). The algebra of preimage commutes with all elementary set operations. Carathéodory theorem Definition 2.9 (outer measure) Given a set \\(\\Omega\\), a function \\(\\mu:2^\\Omega\\to \\mathbb R_{\\geq 0}\\) is an outer measure if it satisfies: non-negativity: \\(\\mu(\\emptyset) = 0\\). monotonicity: \\(A\\subset B\\implies \\mu(A) \\leq \\mu(B)\\). countable sub-additivity: for any countable collection of subsets \\(A_j\\subset \\Omega\\): \\[ \\mu \\bigcup_{j=1}^\\infty A_j \\leq \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\mu(A_j) \\] Definition 2.10 (Carathéodory criteria) Given an outer measure \\(\\mu:2^\\Omega\\to \\mathbb R_{\\geq 0}\\), a set \\(S\\subset \\Omega\\) satisfies the Carathéodory criteria (for measurability) if \\[ \\mu(\\forall E) = \\mu(E\\cap A) + \\mu(E\\cap A^c) \\] The set \\(S\\) is also said to be measurable (by the Carathéodory criteria). Lemma 2.1 (measurable sets form a set-algebra) The set \\(\\Sigma\\subset 2^\\Omega\\) of measurable sets is an algebra of sets that contains \\(\\emptyset, \\Omega\\). Proof We have \\(\\emptyset, \\Omega \\in \\Sigma\\) by definition 2.10 immediately. To show that \\(\\Sigma\\) is closed under countable intersection: given \\(A, B\\in \\Sigma\\), applying the given condition on \\((E, A), (\\cdot, B)\\) yields \\[\\begin{align} \\mu(E) &amp;= \\mu(E\\cap A) + \\mu(E\\cap A^c) \\\\ &amp;= \\mu(E\\cap A\\cap B) + \\mu(E\\cap A\\cap B^c) + \\mu(E\\cap A^c\\cap B) + \\mu(E\\cap A^c \\cap B^c) \\end{align}\\] We wish to show that the RHS equals \\(\\mu(E\\cap A\\cap B) + \\mu(E\\cap (A\\cap B)^c)\\). To this end, note that (using addition in place of union to reduce clutter): \\[\\begin{align} (A\\cap B)^c &amp;= A^c\\cap B + A\\cap B^c + A^c\\cap B^c \\\\ \\mu(E\\cap (A\\cap B)^c) &amp;= \\mu(E\\cap (A\\cap B)^c\\cap A) + \\mu(E\\cap (A\\cap B)^c \\cap A^c) \\\\ &amp;= \\mu(E\\cap A\\cap B^c) + \\mu(E\\cap A^c\\cap B + E\\cap A^c\\cap B^c) \\\\ &amp;= \\mu(E\\cap A\\cap B^c) + \\mu(E\\cap A^c\\cap B) + \\mu(E\\cap A^c\\cap B^c) \\\\ \\end{align}\\] The following lemmas each depend on the previous one and culminates in the Carathéodory theorem. Lemma 2.2 (countable additivity on measurable sets) Given disjoint sets \\(B_1, \\cdots \\in \\Sigma\\): \\[ \\mu \\left( E\\cap \\bigsqcup_{j=1}^\\infty B_j \\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\mu(E\\cap B_j) \\] In particular, \\(\\mu\\) is countable additive on \\(\\Sigma\\) by setting \\(E=\\Omega\\): \\[ \\mu \\bigsqcup_{j=1}^\\infty (B_j\\in \\Sigma) = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\mu(B_j) \\] Proof For disjoint \\(B_1, B_2\\in \\Sigma\\), applying definition 2.10 yields \\(\\mu(B_1\\sqcup B_2) = \\mu(B_1) + \\mu(B_2)\\); finite additivity follows by induction. In particular, this implies the following limit since it holds for each \\(m\\) \\[ \\lim_{m\\to \\infty} \\mu\\left( E\\cap \\bigsqcup_{j=1}^m B_j \\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\mu(E\\cap B_j) \\tag{2.1} \\] We next show countable additivity: given disjoint \\(B_1, \\cdots\\) \\[ \\lim_{m\\to \\infty} \\mu\\left( E\\cap \\bigsqcup_{j=1}^m B_j \\right) \\leq \\mu \\left( E\\cap \\bigsqcup_{j=1}^\\infty B_j \\right) = \\mu \\left(\\bigsqcup_{j=1}^\\infty E\\cap B_j\\right) \\leq \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\mu(E\\cap B_j) \\] But the LHS and RHS are exactly those of equation (2.1), so we obtain the equality by sandwich-ing \\[ \\mu \\left( E\\cap \\bigsqcup_{j=1}^\\infty B_j \\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\mu(E\\cap B_j) \\] Lemma 2.3 (Carathéodory-measurable sets form a sigma-algebra) \\(\\Sigma\\) is a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra; equivalently in light of lemma 2.1, \\[ B_{\\forall j}\\in \\Sigma\\implies \\bigcup_{j=1}^\\infty B_j \\in \\Sigma \\] Proof Without loss of generality assume \\(B_j\\) distinct. One direction follows from countable subadditivity: \\[ \\mu(E) = \\mu((E\\cap B)\\cup (E\\cap B^c)) \\leq \\mu(E\\cap B) + \\mu(E\\cap B^c) \\] For the other direction, the following equation holds for each \\(m\\) thus in limit \\[ \\mu_E = \\lim_{m\\to \\infty} \\mu\\left(E\\cap \\bigcup_{j=1}^m B_j \\right) + \\mu \\left[ E\\cap \\left(\\bigcup_{j=1}^m B_j\\right)^c \\right] \\tag{2.2} \\] The limit of the first term is known to be \\(\\mu(E\\cap B)\\), the second term \\[ \\mu \\left[ E\\cap \\left(\\bigcup_{j=1}^m B_j\\right)^c \\right] \\geq \\mu(E\\cap B^c) \\] by subadditivity; substituting into equation (2.2) completes the proof. \\[ \\mu_E \\geq \\mu\\left(E\\cap \\bigcup_{j=1}^\\infty B_j \\right) + \\mu \\left[ E\\cap \\left(\\bigcup_{j=1}^\\infty B_j\\right)^c \\right] \\] Theorem 2.3 (Carathéodory theorem) Given an outer measure \\(\\mu:2^\\Omega\\to \\mathbb R_{\\geq 0}\\): The collection \\(\\Sigma\\subset 2^\\Omega\\) of subsets satisfying Carathéodory’s criterion is a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra, \\(\\mu:\\Sigma\\to \\mathbb R_{\\geq 0}\\) is a countably additive measure on \\(\\Sigma\\). "],["realMeasures.html", "3 Lebesgue measure Rectangles, exterior measure Lebesgue measure, Borel regularity", " 3 Lebesgue measure This section establishes the base case of the Lebesgue measure on \\(\\mathbb R^n\\): Exterior measure: foundational properties of the exterior measure and interaction with rectangles. Lebesgue measure and Borel regularity: Borel sets, example of a non-measurable set, and approximation characterizations of measurable sets. Key takeaways: The exterior measure is the natural outer-measure extension of rectangle volume that satisfies monotonicity and countable subadditivity. The Lebesgue measure is the Carathéodory restriction of the exterior measure. Rectangles are measurable (proposition 3.4), so Borel sets are measurable since they are freely-generated by rectangles. The exterior measure (rectangle cover infimum) is equivalent to open cover infimum, and on measurable sets equivalent to compact subset supremum. A set is measurable iff it can be upper-approximated by an open cover or lower-approximated by a closed subset up to arbitrarily small but finite measure 3.3. it can be approximated by a Borel set up to zero measure 3.4. it differs from a measurable set by zero measure 3.7. Rectangles, exterior measure Definition 3.1 (exterior measure) The exterior measure \\(\\mu_*(E)\\) of any subset \\(E\\subset \\mathbb R^n\\) is \\[ \\mu_*(E) = \\inf \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty |R_j| \\] where the \\(\\inf\\) is over all countable coverings of \\(E\\) by closed rectangles, the measure of a closed rectangle \\(R_j = \\prod_{j=1}^n [a_j, b_j]\\) is \\(|Q_j| = \\prod_{j=1}^n (b_j - a_j)\\). Proposition 3.1 The exterior is an outer measure per definition 2.9. \\(E_1\\subset E_2\\implies \\mu_*(E_1)\\leq \\mu_*(E_2)\\). \\(E=\\bigcup_{j=1}^\\infty E_j\\implies \\mu_*(E)\\leq \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\mu_*(E_j)\\). Proof To prove monotonicity, every covering of \\(E_2\\) by a countable set of cubes is also a covering of \\(E_1\\). For countable subadditivity, the main idea is to construct increasingly tight covers such that the countable union of these covers is still finitely tight. Assume the nontrivial case \\(\\mu_*(E_j)&lt;\\infty\\). For every \\(\\epsilon&gt;0\\), we can construct for each \\(j\\) a covering \\[ E_j\\subset \\bigcup_{k=1}^\\infty R_{k, j}, \\quad \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty |R_{k, j}| \\leq \\mu_*(E_j) + \\dfrac{\\epsilon}{2^j} \\] The increasingly tight bound ensures that \\[\\begin{align} \\mu_*(E) &amp;\\leq \\sum_{j, k}|R_{k, j}| \\leq \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\mu_*(E_j) + \\dfrac\\epsilon {2^j} = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\mu_*(E_j)+\\epsilon \\end{align}\\] Proposition 3.2 (equivalence with open cover infimum) Given \\(E\\subset \\mathbb R^n\\), \\(\\mu_*(E)=\\inf \\mu_*(\\mathcal O)\\), where \\(\\inf\\) is over all open sets \\(\\mathcal O\\) covering \\(E\\). Proof \\(\\mu_*(E)\\leq \\inf \\mu_*(\\mathcal O)\\) holds by monotonicity. For the other direction, choose cubes \\(R_j\\) covering \\(E\\) with margin \\(\\epsilon/2\\), and for each cube choose open cube \\(O_j\\) covering \\(R_j\\) with margin \\(\\epsilon/2^{j+1}\\), then \\((O_j)\\) cover \\(E\\) with margin \\(\\epsilon\\). Given a countable set \\(R_j\\) of disjoint rectangles, it is intuitive (and easy to show that) \\[ \\mu_*\\bigsqcup_{j=1}^\\infty R_j = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\mu_*(R_j) \\] This is our base case for establishing measurability later on. The following proposition is the main reason why we chose closed rectangles (instead of open, though they are effectively the same) as the basic measurable sets. Proposition 3.3 (additivity with finite distance) If \\(E=E_1\\cup E_2\\) and \\(d(E_1, E_2)&gt;0\\), then \\[ \\mu_*(E) = \\mu_*(E_1)+\\mu_*(E_2) \\] Proof By subadditivity, \\(\\mu_*(E)\\leq \\mu_*(E_1)+\\mu_*(E_2)\\). To show the converse, select \\(0&lt;\\delta &lt; d(E_1, E_2)\\) and choose a cover \\((Q_j)\\) of \\(E\\) by closed cubes with margin \\(\\epsilon\\). Subdivide \\((Q_j)\\) so that each has size less than \\(\\delta\\), so that each cube intersects at most one of \\(E_1, E_2\\). Denote by \\(J_1, J_2\\) the indices for which \\(Q_j\\) intersects \\(E_1, E_2\\), then \\(E_1, E_2\\) are covered by \\(Q_{J_1}, Q_{J_2}\\) respectively. Corollary 3.1 (additivity of almost-disjoint rectangles) The exterior measure is additive on countable collections of almost-disjoint rectangles \\(R_j\\in \\mathbb R^d\\). Proof Give \\(\\epsilon&gt;0\\), shrink rectangle \\(j\\) by \\(\\epsilon/2^j\\) so they are closed sets with finite distance, then invoke additivity through proposition 3.3. Proposition 3.4 (Carathéodory criteria for rectangles) Given a rectangle \\(\\subset \\mathbb R^n\\), \\[ \\mu_*(\\forall E\\subset \\mathbb R^n) = \\mu_*(E\\cap R)+ \\mu_*(E\\cap R^c) \\] Proof To prove the nontrivial direction \\(\\mu_*(E\\cap R)+ \\mu_*(E\\cap R^c)\\leq \\mu_*(\\forall E\\subset \\mathbb R^n)\\), choose an \\(\\epsilon\\)-cover \\(R_j\\) of \\(E\\), then rectang-ify \\(R_j\\) into \\(R^1_j, R^2_j\\) covering \\(E\\cap R, E\\cap R^c\\) respectively and invoke corollary 3.1. This shows that \\[ \\mu_*(E\\cap R)+ \\mu_*(E\\cap R^c) \\leq \\mu_*(\\forall E\\subset \\mathbb R^n) + \\epsilon, \\quad \\forall \\epsilon&gt;0 \\] Boundaries to not always have nontrivial measures (e.g. \\(\\mathbb Q\\cap [0, 1]\\)). There are even boundaries of closed sets which have nontrivial measure (e.g. fat Cantor set). Lebesgue measure, Borel regularity Definition 3.2 (Lebesgue measure) The set \\(\\mathcal L\\subset \\mathbb R^n\\) of Lebesgue measurable sets are the Carathéodory-measurable sets of the exterior measure: \\[ S\\in \\mathcal L \\iff \\mu_*(\\forall E\\subset \\mathbb R^n) = \\mu_*(E\\cap S)+\\mu_*(E\\cap S^c) \\] Note that one direction in the Carathéodory criterion always holds by subadditivity: \\[ \\mu_*(E) \\leq \\mu_*(E\\cap B) + \\mu_*(E\\cap B^c) \\] Proposition 3.5 (null sets are measurable) \\(\\mu(E\\subset \\mathbb R^n)=0\\implies E\\in \\mathcal L\\). Proof To show the nontrivial direction, \\(\\mu(E\\cap B)\\leq \\mu(E)=0\\), then \\(\\mu(E\\cap B^c) \\leq \\mu(E)\\) by subadditivity. Proposition 3.6 Proposition 3.7 If \\(\\mu_*(A\\Delta B) = 0\\) for \\(\\in \\mathcal L\\), then \\(A\\) is measurable. Proof Without loss of generality assume \\(B\\subset A\\). We wish to show thenontrivial direction \\[\\begin{align} \\mu_*(\\forall E) &amp;\\geq \\mu_*(E\\cap A) + \\mu_*(E\\cap A^c) \\end{align}\\] The second term \\(\\mu_*(E\\cap A^c)\\leq \\mu_*(E\\cap B^c)\\) by subadditivity, and the first term \\[ \\mu_*(E\\cap A) \\leq \\mu_*(E\\cap B) + \\mu_*(E\\cap (A-B)) \\leq \\mu_*(E\\cap B) + \\mu_*(A-B)_{=0} \\] Then \\(\\mu_*(E\\cap A) + \\mu_*(E\\cap A^c)\\leq \\mu_*(E\\cap B) + \\mu_*(E\\cap B^c) = \\mu_*(E)\\) by \\(B\\) measurable. Definition 3.3 (Borel sets) The Borel set \\(\\mathcal B\\subset 2^{R^n}\\) is the \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra freely generated by rectangles. Theorem 3.1 (Borel sets are Lebesgue measurable) \\(\\mathcal B\\subset \\mathcal L\\). Proof: Proposition 3.4 states that rectangles are measurable; invoking the machinery we built in the section on the Carathéodory theorem we obtain that the elements of the \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra freely generated by rectangles (Borel subsets) are measurable. A non-measurable set Write \\(x\\sim y\\) if \\(x-y\\) is rational and let \\(\\mathcal E_\\alpha\\) be the equivalence class of \\(\\alpha\\). Then \\([0, 1]=\\bigcup \\mathcal E_\\alpha\\) and construct \\(\\mathcal N\\) by choosing one element \\(x_\\alpha\\) from each \\(\\mathcal E_\\alpha\\). Proposition 3.8 \\(\\mathcal N\\) is not measurable. Proof: Assume \\(\\mathcal N\\) measurable and let \\(\\{r_k\\}_{k=1}^\\infty\\) be an enumeration of all rationals in \\([-1, 1]\\) and consider \\(\\mathcal N_k = \\mathcal N + r_k\\). Then all \\(\\{\\mathcal N_k\\}\\) are disjoint. Note that \\[ [0, 1] \\subset \\bigsqcup_{k=1}^\\infty \\mathcal N_k \\subset [-1, 2] \\] Assuming measurability (contradiction!), we have \\[ 1\\leq \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\mu(\\mathcal N_k) \\leq 3 \\] Every term in the sum is equal, but there is no real number which satisfies the construction above; contradiction: there cannot be a disjoint-additive function on the disjoint countable collection \\(\\{\\mathcal N_k\\}\\). Approximation of measurable sets We have seen that the exterior measure is equivalent to open cover infinum 3.2. We also have Proposition 3.9 (compact subset supremum) If \\(A\\) is Lebesgue measurable, then \\[ \\mu(A) = \\sup_{K\\subset A\\text{ compact}} \\mu(K) \\] Proof The trivial direction is \\(\\sup_{K\\subset A\\text{ compact}} \\mu(K) \\leq \\mu(A)\\). We wish to show, \\(\\forall \\epsilon&gt;0\\), that \\[ \\exists K\\subset A\\text{ compact}: \\mu(K) + \\epsilon \\geq \\mu(A) \\] Figure 3.1: \\(A\\) bounded First suppose \\(A\\) bounded; consider compact \\(F\\supset A\\), then there is an open set \\(G\\supset F-A\\) which \\(\\epsilon\\)-approximates \\(F-A\\), then \\(K=A\\cap O^c\\) is a compact sub-\\(\\epsilon\\) subset approximation of \\(A\\). \\(K\\) must be compact, else \\(F\\subset K\\cup O\\) will not be compact. \\(A\\) unbounded: we can construct for each \\(j\\in \\mathbb N\\) an \\(\\epsilon\\)-approximation of \\(A_j = A\\cap \\overline{B_j(0)}\\) with \\(A_j\\to A\\implies \\mu(A_j)\\to \\mu(A)\\). Theorem 3.2 (measurability by open cover approximation) \\(A\\subset \\mathbb R^n\\) is Lebesgue measurable iff \\(\\forall \\epsilon&gt;0\\), there exists \\(G\\supset A\\) such that \\[ \\mu_*(G - A) &lt; \\epsilon \\] Proof Given \\(A\\) measurable, the result follows from open cover infimum proposition 3.2. Conversely, suppose \\(A\\subset \\mathbb R^n\\) satisfies the conditions in the theorem, then choose an \\(\\epsilon\\)-cover \\(G\\supset A\\). Note that \\[ E\\cap A^c = E\\cap G^c + E\\cap (G-A) \\] Directly verify the Carathéodory criterion: we use the measurability of \\(G\\) and subadditivity \\[\\begin{align} \\mu_*(E\\cap A) + \\mu_*(E\\cap A^c) &amp;= \\mu_*(E\\cap A) + \\mu_*(E\\cap A^c) \\\\ &amp;\\leq \\mu_*(E\\cap G) + \\mu_*(E\\cap G^c) + \\mu_*(E\\cap (G-A)) \\\\ &amp;\\leq \\mu_*(E\\cap G) + \\mu_*(E\\cap G^c) + \\mu_*(G-A)_{&lt; \\epsilon} \\\\ &amp;&lt; \\mu_*(E\\cap G) + \\mu_*(E\\cap G^c) + \\epsilon = \\mu_*(E\\cap G) + \\epsilon \\end{align}\\] Theorem 3.3 (inner and outer regularity) \\(A\\subset \\mathbb R^n\\) is Lebesgue measurable iff \\(\\forall \\epsilon&gt;0\\), there exists open \\(G\\), closed \\(F\\), with \\(F\\subset A\\subset G\\) such that \\(\\mu_*(G - F) &lt; \\epsilon\\). Proof: If \\(A\\) satisfies the theorem conditions, then \\(\\mu_*(G - A) \\leq \\mu_*(G - F)&lt;\\epsilon\\) so \\(A\\) is measurable by theorem 3.2. Conversely, given \\(A\\) measurable, by theorem 3.2 choose \\(\\epsilon/2\\)-covers of both \\(A\\) and \\(A^c\\). Theorem 3.4 (measurability by Borel approximation) \\(A\\subset \\mathbb R^n\\) is Lebesgue measurable iff there exists Borel sets \\(G, F\\) with \\(F\\subset A\\subset G\\) such that \\[ \\mu(G - A) = \\mu(A - F) = 0 \\] Proof: By theorem 3.3, construct for each \\(k\\in \\mathbb N\\) sets \\(G_k, F_k\\) which \\(1/k\\)-squeeze \\(G\\), then \\(G=\\bigcap G_k, F=\\bigcup F_k\\) proves the theorem.

Littlewood’s three principles: Every measurable set on \\(\\mathbb R\\) can be approximated up to arbitrary but finite tolerance by a finite union of open intervals. Egorov’s theorem 4.3: for every finite (but arbitrary) tolerance to approximating a domain with finite measure, pointwise convergence a.e. is uniform convergence.

General technique: prove for characteristic functions, then generalize using approximation and limit theorems. Fatou’s lemma can be used to2. Sufficient conditions for measurability: semicontinuous, monotonic, the pointwise limit of a measurable sequence, or equals a measurable function a.e. Properties of the Lebesgue integral: \\(f\\) integrable iff \\(|f|\\) integrable. disjoint additivity w.r.t. domain. linear and order-preserving. sets of measure zero are negligible. Measurable functions on \\(\\mathbb R^n\\) Simple functions Definition 4.1 (characteristic function) Given \\(E\\subset \\Omega\\), the characteristic function \\(\\chi_E:\\Omega\\to \\mathbb R\\) is \\[ \\chi_E(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; x\\in E \\\\ 0 &amp; x\\notin E \\end{cases} \\] Proposition 4.1 Given \\((\\Omega, \\Sigma), E\\subset \\Omega\\), then \\(\\chi_E\\) is \\(\\Sigma\\)-measurable iff \\(E\\in \\Sigma\\). Proof: \\(\\chi_E^{-1}(B) = \\{E, \\Omega-E, \\Omega, \\emptyset\\}\\) depending on how \\(B\\subset \\mathbb R\\) intersects with \\(\\{0, 1\\}\\). Definition 4.2 (simple function) A simple function is a finite sum below, where each \\(E_k\\) is a finite-measurable set. \\[ f = \\sum_{k=1}^N a_k \\chi_{E_k} \\] Theorem 4.1 (simple-function approximation) Given a real function \\(f:\\Omega\\to \\mathbb R\\), there exists a sequence \\(\\{s_n\\}\\) of simple functions such that \\(s_n(x)\\to f(x)\\) point-wise. If \\(f\\) is measurable, then \\(\\{s_n\\}\\) may be chosen to be a sequence of measurable functions. If \\(f\\geq 0\\), then \\(\\{s_n\\}\\) may be chosen to be a monotonically increasing sequence. Proof idea: in the \\(n\\)-th approximation, approximate \\(f\\geq 0\\) (general case follows by \\(f=f^+-f^-\\)) up to value \\(n\\) by (1) divide \\(f^{-1}([0, n])\\) into \\(2^{n}\\) pieces, (2) assign a dominated to each of \\(2^n\\) intervals, and (3) approximate \\(f(x)&gt;n\\) with \\(n\\). Proof Given \\(f\\geq 0\\), define \\(F_n = f^{-1}([n, \\infty))\\) and \\[ E_{n, i} = f^{-1} \\left(\\left[2^{-n}(i-1), 2^{-n}i \\right]\\right) \\] For \\(n=1, 2, \\cdots\\) and \\(i=1, 2, \\cdots, n2^n\\), choose \\[ s_n = n\\chi_{F_n} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n2^n} \\dfrac{i-1}{2^n} \\chi_{E_{n, i}} \\] Note that \\(E_{n, i}\\) is the pre-image of the \\(i\\)-th slice of nonnegative real blocks of size \\(2^{-n}\\), and the first term assigns \\(\\inf f=2^{-n}(i-1)\\) on the corresponding intervals. The second term just assigns approximates with \\(n\\) all places where \\(f(x)\\geq n\\). The second term is reserved for cases where \\(f(x)=\\infty\\). If \\(f\\) is measurable, the domains of the characteristic decomposition are measurable so \\(s_n\\) is measurable. The general case follows by \\(f=f^+-f^-\\). Conditions for measurability Example 4.1 If \\(\\Sigma=\\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}\\), then the only \\(\\Sigma\\)-measurable functions from \\(\\Omega\\to \\mathbb R^n\\) are constant functions. On the other extreme, if \\(\\Sigma=2^\\Omega\\), then every function is measurable. For a nontrivial example, if \\(\\Sigma=\\{\\emptyset, (-\\infty, 0), [0, \\infty), \\mathbb R\\}\\) then \\(f:\\mathbb R\\to \\mathbb R\\) is measurable iff it is constant on \\((-\\infty, 0), [0, \\infty)\\). Proposition 4.2 (semi-continuity implies measurability) Every (lower or upper) semi-continuous \\(R^n\\)-valued function (definition 1.4) is measurable. Proof: Recall proposition 2.6. The Borel \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra is generated by half-rectangles \\((\\infty, t\\in \\mathbb R^n)\\) or \\((t, \\infty)\\) The explicit proof below demonstrates the relation between continuity and measurability. Proposition 4.3 (continuity implies Borel measurability) Every continuous function \\(f:\\Omega\\to \\mathbb R^n\\) defined on a Borel subset \\(\\Omega\\subset \\mathbb R^m\\) is a Borel-measurable function. Proof Consider the preimage of \\(x&gt;a\\) (\\(x, a\\in \\mathbb R^n\\) and inequality holds elementwise). For any such \\(a\\), consider \\[ f^{-1}(x&gt;a) = \\left[\\bigcup_{x\\in f^{-1}(x&gt;a)} (x-\\delta_x, x+\\delta_x) \\right]\\cap \\Omega \\] Given every \\(x\\in \\mathbb R^m: f(x)&gt;a\\), by continuity \\(\\exists \\delta_x\\in \\mathbb R\\) such that \\(f((x-\\delta_x, x+\\delta_x))&gt;a\\). The term in the paranthesis is an open set, hence its intersection with the Borel set \\(\\Omega\\) is Borel. \\(f:(\\Omega\\subset \\mathbb R)\\to \\mathbb R\\) is increasing if \\(x &lt; y\\implies f(x)\\leq f(y)\\); it is monotonic if \\(f\\) or \\(-f\\) is increasing. Proposition 4.4 if \\(f:\\Omega\\to \\mathbb R\\) is monotonic and \\(\\Omega\\) is Borel, then \\(f\\) is measurable. Proof Fix \\(a\\in \\mathbb R\\), then for \\(b=\\inf f^{-1}((a, \\infty))\\), monotonicity implies \\[ f^{-1}((a, \\infty)) = (b, \\infty)\\cap \\Omega \\text{ or } [b, \\infty)\\cap \\Omega \\] Proposition 4.5 (preservation of measurability under limits) Suppose a measurable sequence \\(\\{f_j\\}\\to f:(\\Omega, \\Sigma)\\to \\mathbb R^n\\) pointwise is \\(\\Sigma\\)-measurable, then \\(f\\) is \\(\\Sigma\\)-measurable. Proof Unrolling the definition of the limit: for any \\(x\\in \\Omega, a\\in \\mathbb R^n\\), \\(f(x)&gt;a\\) iff \\[\\begin{align} &amp; \\lim_{k\\to \\infty} f_k(x) &gt; a \\\\ \\iff &amp; \\exists j&gt;0, \\exists N: f_{\\forall k&gt;N}(x)&gt;a+1/j \\\\ \\iff &amp; x\\in \\bigcup_{j=1}^\\infty \\bigcup_{N=1}^\\infty \\bigcap_{k=1}^\\infty f_k^{-1}(y&gt;a+1/j) \\end{align}\\] Note that we only need some \\(j\\) to exist. Each \\(\\exists\\) translates to \\(\\bigcup\\), and each \\(\\forall\\) translates to \\(\\bigcap\\). Then the preimage of \\(y&gt;a\\) the measurable set above. Definition 4.3 (extended Borel) \\(A\\subset [-\\infty \\infty]\\) is a Borel set if \\(A\\cap \\mathbb R\\) is Borel. Extended measurability is defined similarly. Theorem 4.2 (variational limits are measurable) Given measurable \\(\\{f_k: (\\Omega, \\Sigma)\\to \\mathbb R\\}\\), the following functions are also measurable: \\[ g(x) = \\inf_k f_k(x), \\quad h(x) = \\sup_k f_k(x) \\] Proof It suffices to verify for the \\(\\sup\\) case that \\[\\begin{align} h(x) &gt; a &amp;\\implies \\exists k: f_k(x) &gt; a \\\\ h^{-1}((a, \\infty]) &amp;= \\bigcup_{k=1}^\\infty f_k^{-1}((a, \\infty]) \\end{align}\\] Proposition 4.6 (a.e. measurability) Given \\(f\\) measurable and \\(f=g\\) a.e. (they differ on a set of measure \\(0\\) on the domain), then \\(g\\) is measurable. Proof The symmetric difference of the pre-images \\(f^{-1}, g^{-1}\\) is dominated by a set of measure \\(0\\), then by \\(f\\)-measurability \\(g^{-1}(A)\\) is measurable for \\(A\\) measurable (proposition 3.7). Littlewood’s three principles Littlewood’s three principles (at least the ones we prove) apply to \\(\\mathbb R\\) and real-valued functions on the real domain. Every finite-measurable set is almost a finite union of intervals. Every measurable function is almost continuous. Every pointwise convergent sequence of measurable functions is almost uniformly convergent. It is convenient to first introduce some notation for monotone limits. Definition 4.4 (sequence of sets) An increasing sequence of sets \\(\\{A_n\\}\\) is a sequence \\[ A_1\\subset A_2\\subset \\cdots \\to A = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty A_n \\] also written \\(A_j\\nearrow A\\). Similarly, a decreasing sequence of sets is written \\(A_j\\searrow A\\). \\[ A_1\\supset A_2\\supset \\cdots \\to A = \\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty A_n \\] Proposition 4.7 (Littlewood's first principle) Given measurable \\(E\\subset \\mathbb R\\) with \\(\\mu(E)&lt;\\infty\\), there exists a finite union \\(O\\) of intervals such that \\(\\mu(O\\Delta E) &lt; \\epsilon\\) for every \\(\\epsilon\\). Proof idea: prove for open \\(E\\) and apply theorem 3.3. Proof Every open set \\(O\\) is the interval of countably many disjoint open intervals (this is because every disjoint interval contains a rational number, of which there are countably many), then \\(\\mu(O) = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\mu((a_j, b_j))\\). Thus for every \\(\\epsilon&gt;0\\) we can choose a \\(\\epsilon\\)-approximation with finite intervals. Apply theorem 3.3 to obtain the result for general measurable sets. To be precise, the third principle is formulated as follows: Theorem 4.3 (Egorov's theorem) Consider a measurable sequence \\(f_k\\to f\\) a.e. on a finite-measurable set \\(E\\) with \\(\\mu(E)&lt;\\infty\\). For every \\(\\epsilon&gt;0\\), there exists a closed set \\(A_\\epsilon \\subset E\\) such that \\(f_k\\to f\\) uniformly and \\(\\mu(E-A_\\epsilon)&lt;\\epsilon\\) on \\(A_\\epsilon\\). Proof idea: given domain tolerance \\(\\epsilon\\), construct by pointwise convergence a family \\(F_n\\) of \\((\\epsilon 2^{-n})\\)-domain approximations on which \\(f_j\\) will uniformly \\(1/n\\)-approximate \\(f\\) on \\(F_n\\). Then \\(f_j\\to f\\) uniformly on the intersection \\(A_\\epsilon\\) of \\(F_n\\), which is also an \\(\\epsilon\\)-domain approximation. Proof Note that we can’t simply use compactness here since the domain approximation may be unbounded. Translate pointwise convergence: fixing \\(n\\in \\mathbb N\\), for every \\(x\\in X\\) there exists \\(m\\in \\mathbb N\\) such that \\(f_{\\forall k\\geq m}\\) will \\(\\epsilon\\)-approximate \\(f\\) at \\(x\\), then \\[ X = \\bigcup_{m=1}^\\infty A_{m, n}, \\quad A_{m, n} = \\bigcap_{k=m}^\\infty \\{x: |f_k(x) - f(x)| &lt; 1/n\\} \\] Here \\(A_{m, n}\\) is the domain on which \\(f_{\\forall k\\geq m}\\) will \\(1/n\\)-approximate \\(f\\). Given domain tolerance \\(\\epsilon&gt;0\\), for each \\(n&gt;0\\) we can find \\(m_n\\) such that \\[ \\mu(X) - \\mu(A_{m_n, n}) &lt; \\dfrac\\epsilon {2^n} \\] This definition implies that \\(f_{\\forall j\\geq m_n}\\) will \\(1/n\\)-approximate \\(f\\) on \\(A_{m_n, n}\\). Let \\(A_\\epsilon = \\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty A_{m_n, n}\\); then for every \\(\\epsilon&#39;&gt;1/N&gt;0\\), \\(f\\) will be \\(\\epsilon&#39;\\)-approximated by \\(f_{j\\geq m_N}\\) on \\(A_\\epsilon \\subset A_{M_N, N} \\subset A_\\epsilon\\). Argue for \\(\\epsilon\\)-approximation of the domain: \\[\\begin{align} \\mu(\\Omega - A_\\epsilon) &amp;= \\mu \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty \\Omega - A_{m_n, n} \\leq \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\epsilon/2^n &lt; \\epsilon \\end{align}\\] We can choose \\(A_\\epsilon\\) to be closed by the characterization of measurable sets (theorem 3.3). Similarly, the precise statement of the second principle is as follows. Note that does not claim that \\(f\\) is pointwise continuous on \\(F_\\epsilon\\) in the topology of \\(\\mathbb R\\), only that \\(f_{|F_\\epsilon}\\) is continuous in the subspace topology. Lemma 4.1 Given a Borel-measurable \\(f:\\mathbb R\\to \\mathbb R\\), for every \\(\\epsilon&gt;0\\) there exists a closed \\(F\\subset \\mathbb R\\) with \\(|\\mathbb R- F|&lt;\\epsilon\\) such that \\(f_{|F}\\) is continuous on \\(F\\). Proof idea: establish for (1) simple functions, (2) arbitrary functions on compact interval, using pointwise approximation by simple functions and Egorov’s theorem, and (3) extended domain by pasting local chunks. a.e. Proof First assume \\(f = \\sum_{j=1}^N \\alpha_j \\chi_{E_j}\\). By theorem 3.3 choose \\(U_j\\supset E_j\\supset F_j\\) with \\(U_j\\) open, \\(F_j\\) closed, and both are \\((\\epsilon/2n)\\)-approximations of \\(E_j\\). The closed set is the union of each \\(F_j\\) and \\(U_j^c\\): \\[ E = F \\cup (\\mathbb R- U), \\quad F = \\bigcup_{j=1}^N F_j, \\quad U = \\bigcup_{j=1}^N U_j \\] both \\(F, U^c\\) are closed and \\(\\mu(\\mathbb R-E) &lt; \\epsilon\\). Continuity on \\(E\\) follows by \\(f\\) being constantly zero on disjoint closed intervals, so the pasting lemma applies. Next consider general \\(f\\) on a compact interval. Every \\(f\\) is the pointwise limit of simple functions (theorem 4.1) and their uniform limit on a closed subset (Egorov’s theorem 4.3) thus continuous. To extend the domain, construct \\(\\epsilon\\cdot 2^{-n-1}\\)-approximations to \\(f\\) on \\([-n, 1-n]\\) and \\([n-1, n]\\) and apply the pasting lemma. Theorem 4.4 (Luzin's theorem) Given a Borel measurable \\(f:(E\\subset \\mathbb R)\\to \\mathbb R\\), for every \\(\\epsilon&gt;0\\) there exists a closed \\(\\epsilon\\)-approximation \\(F \\subset E\\) such that \\(f_{|F}\\) is continuous in the subspace topology. Proof: Apply lemma 4.1 to the continuous extension of \\(f\\) to all of \\(\\mathbb R\\). Lebesgue integration Definition 4.5 (function support) The support of a measurable function \\(f\\) is \\[ \\mathrm{supp}(f) = \\overline{f^{-1}(\\{0\\}^C)} \\] the closure of domain on which \\(f\\) does not vanish. Definition 4.6 (S-partition) Given a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra \\(\\Sigma\\) on \\(\\Omega\\), a \\(S\\)-partition of \\(\\Omega\\) is a finite collection \\(A_1, \\cdots, A_m\\in \\Sigma\\) of disjoint sets such that \\(\\bigsqcup A_j = \\Omega\\). Definition 4.7 (lower Lebesgue sum) Given measure space \\((\\Omega, \\Sigma, \\mu)\\), an \\(\\Sigma\\)-measurable function \\(f:\\Omega\\to [0, \\infty]\\), and a \\(\\Sigma\\)-partition \\(P=\\{A_1, \\cdots, A_m\\}\\) of \\(\\Omega\\), the lower Lebesgue sum is \\[ \\mathcal L_\\mu(f, P) = \\sum_{j=1}^m \\mu(A_j)\\inf_{A_j} f \\] Definition 4.8 (nonnegative integral) The integral of a non-negative function \\(f:\\Omega\\to [0, \\infty]\\) w.r.t. the measure \\((\\Sigma, \\mu)\\) is the following \\(\\sup\\) with \\(P\\) over all S-partitions of \\(\\Omega\\): \\[ \\int f\\, d\\mu = \\sup_P \\mathcal L_\\mu(f, P) \\] Proposition 4.8 (base case for Lebesgue integral) Given \\((\\Omega, \\Sigma, \\mu)\\) and measurable \\(E\\in \\Sigma\\), we have \\(\\int \\chi_E\\, d\\mu = \\mu(E)\\). Proof We have \\(\\mathcal L_\\mu(\\chi_E, \\{E, \\Omega-E\\}) = \\mu(E)\\), then \\(\\int f\\, d\\mu \\geq \\mu(E)\\). Conversely, given any S-partition \\(P=\\{A_1, \\cdots, A_m\\}\\) of \\(\\Omega\\), for each \\(j\\) \\[ \\mu(A_j) \\inf_{A_j} \\chi_E = \\begin{cases} \\mu(A_j) &amp; A_j\\subset E \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\] then \\(\\mathcal L(\\chi_E, P) = \\sum_{A_j\\subset E} \\mu(A_j) \\leq \\mu(E)\\). Proposition 4.9 (integral of a simple function) Given a measure space \\((\\Omega, \\Sigma, \\mu)\\) and disjoint \\(E_1, \\cdots E_n\\), we have \\[ \\int \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n c_k \\chi_{E_k}\\right)\\, d\\mu = \\sum_{k=1}^n c_k \\mu(E_k) \\] Proof The LHS integral is lower-bounded by the \\(\\Sigma\\)-partition \\(\\{E_j\\}\\cup \\{\\Omega-\\bigcup E_j\\}\\). The converse follows similar to the last proposition. Corollary 4.1 (equivalent definition of nonnegative integral) Given \\((\\Omega, \\Sigma, \\mu)\\) and measurable \\(f:\\Omega\\to [0, \\infty]\\), the integral definition 4.8 is equivalent to \\[ \\int f\\, d\\mu = \\sup_P \\mathcal L_\\mu(f, P) = \\sup_{s\\leq f} \\int s\\, d\\mu \\] where the last \\(\\sup\\) is taken over all simple function \\(f\\) dominated by \\(f\\): \\(\\forall x\\in \\Omega: f(x)\\geq s(x)\\). Proof: Follows from \\(\\mathcal L_\\mu(f, P)\\) being the integral of a simple function. Definition 4.9 (Lebesgue integral) Given \\((\\Omega, \\Sigma, \\mu)\\) and measurable \\(f(x)\\in [-\\infty, \\infty]\\) with \\(f=f^+-f^-\\) and \\(f^+, f^-\\geq 0\\). If at least one of \\(\\int f^+\\, d\\mu, \\int f^-\\, d\\mu\\) is finite, then the Lebesgue integral of \\(f\\) is \\[ \\int f\\, d\\mu = \\int f^+\\, d\\mu - \\int f^-\\, d\\mu \\] Note that, for example, the integral of the following function is not defined: \\[ f(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; x\\geq 0 \\\\ -1 &amp; x &lt; 0 \\end{cases} \\] Definition 4.10 (integral metric, integrable space) Fix \\((\\Omega, \\Sigma, \\mu)\\); if \\(f:\\Omega\\to [-\\infty, \\infty]\\) is measurable, then the \\(L^1\\)-norm of \\(f\\) is \\[ \\|f_1\\| = \\int |f|\\, d\\mu \\] The Lebesgue space \\(L^1(\\mu)\\) is also defined as \\(L^1(\\mu) = \\{f:\\Omega\\to \\mathbb R\\text{ satisfying } \\|f\\|_1 &lt; \\infty \\}\\). Theorem 4.5 (properties of integration) The following properties are evident for \\(f, g\\in L^1(\\mu)\\): Linearity: \\(\\int cf+g\\, d\\mu = c\\int f\\, d\\mu + \\int g\\, d\\mu\\). Order-preserving: \\(f\\leq g\\implies \\int f\\, d\\mu \\leq \\int g\\, d\\mu\\). \\(\\left|\\int f\\, d\\mu\\right| \\leq \\int |f|\\, d\\mu\\). Proof General idea is to establish for simple functions, then show that the proof commutes with integral construction. For (2), use \\(\\int g\\, d\\mu - \\int f\\, d\\mu = \\int (g-f)\\, d\\mu\\). For (3), \\[\\begin{align} \\left|\\int f\\, d\\mu\\right| &amp;= \\left| \\int f^+\\, d\\mu - \\int f^-\\, d\\mu\\right| \\leq \\int f^+\\, d\\mu + \\int f^-\\, d\\mu \\\\ &amp;= \\int (f^++f^-)\\, d\\mu = \\int |f|\\, d\\mu \\end{align}\\] Definition 4.11 (integration on subset) Given \\((\\Omega, \\Sigma, \\mu)\\) and \\(E\\in \\Sigma\\) and measurable \\(f:\\Omega\\to [-\\infty, \\infty]\\), the subset integral is \\[ \\int_E f\\, d\\mu = \\int \\chi_E f\\, d\\mu \\] Proposition 4.10 (integral bound) Given \\(\\int_E f\\, d\\mu &lt; \\infty\\), \\[ \\left|\\int_E f\\, d\\mu \\right| \\leq \\mu(E) \\sup_E |f| \\] Proof Let \\(c=\\sup_E |f|\\), then \\(\\displaystyle \\left|\\int_E f\\, d\\mu\\right| \\leq \\int \\chi_E |f|\\, d\\mu \\leq \\int c\\chi_E \\, d\\mu = c\\mu(E)\\). Theorem 4.6 (disjoint additivity w.r.t domain) Given measurable \\(f\\), define the function \\(\\phi:\\Sigma\\to [-\\infty, \\infty]\\) by \\[ \\phi(A) = \\int_A f\\, d\\mu \\] then for every \\(A, B\\in \\Sigma\\), we have \\(\\phi(A\\sqcup B) = \\phi(A)+\\phi(B)\\). Proof Without loss of generality consider nonnegative \\(f\\). If \\(f\\) is a characteristic function, then countable additivity is equivalent to the countable subadditivity of \\(\\mu\\). The general proof just demonstrates the commutativity of countable subadditivity with the \\(\\sup\\) integral construction. Corollary 4.2 (sets of zero measure are negligible in integration) Given \\(A, B\\in \\Sigma\\) such that \\(\\mu(A-B)=0\\), then \\[ \\int_A f\\, d\\mu = \\int_B f\\, d\\mu \\] Proof Follows from additivity theorem 4.6 and applying \\(\\mu(A-B)=0\\) to proposition 4.10. The integrability of \\(f\\) implies that of \\(|f|\\), and the Lebesgue integral is often called an absolutely convergent integral. Proposition 4.11 (several conditions for integrability) \\(f\\in L^1(\\mu)\\implies |f|\\in L^1(\\mu)\\). \\(f\\) is measur_Proof:_able and \\(|f|\\leq g \\in L^1(\\mu)\\implies f\\in L^1(\\mu)\\). Proof: for (1), recall that \\(f\\in L^1(\\mu)\\) if both \\(f^+, f^-\\) have finite integrals, then \\(|f|=f^++f^-\\) is integrable. Similarly, (2) follows from \\(f^+, f^-\\leq g\\). Convergence theorems The following convergence theorems are the cornerstone of Lebesgue theory: Theorem 4.7 (Lebesgue's monotone convergence theorem) Given \\(E\\) measurable, let \\(\\{f_n\\}\\) be a sequence of measurable functions such that \\(0\\leq f_1\\leq \\cdots\\) on \\(E\\) and \\(f_n\\to f\\), then \\[ \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\int_E f_n \\, d\\mu = \\int_E \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} f_n\\, d\\mu \\] Pointwise monotone convergence of measurable functions on a measurable set implies convergence of integral. Proof idea: one direction of the inequality is trivial; the other is established by first proving for a dominated simple approximations of \\(f\\) then taking the \\(\\sup\\). Proof In one direction, the implied equation holds for each \\(m\\) thus in limit \\[ f_n \\leq f\\implies \\lim_{m\\to \\infty} \\int f_m\\, d\\mu \\leq \\int_E \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} f_n \\, d\\mu \\] To establish the other direction, fix \\(c\\in (0, 1)\\) and a dominated simple approximation \\(s\\leq f\\). Define \\[ E_n = \\{x| f_n \\geq c s\\} \\] Note that \\(E_j \\nearrow E\\) (recall notation 4.4). For every \\(n\\) \\[ \\int_E f_n \\, d\\mu \\geq \\int_{E_n} f_n\\, d\\mu \\geq c\\int_{E_n} s\\, d\\mu \\] Let \\(n\\to \\infty\\) and take the limit \\(c\\to 1\\) to obtain \\[ \\int \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} f_n\\, d\\mu \\geq \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\int_{E_n} f_n \\, d\\mu \\geq c\\int_E s\\, d\\mu \\] Take the \\(\\sup\\) over all \\(s\\) and the simple function approximation theorem 4.1 to obtain \\(F\\geq \\int_E f\\, d\\mu\\). Applying the monotone convergence theorem above to partial sums yield Corollary 4.3 Given measurable \\(E\\in \\Sigma\\) and nonnegative measurable sequence \\((f_j)\\); define their sum \\[ f = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty f_n \\] then \\(\\int_E f = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\int_E f_n\\, d\\mu\\). Lemma 4.2 (Fatou's lemma) For measurable \\(E\\), given nonnegative measurable sequence \\((f_j)\\) and \\[ f(x) = \\liminf_{n\\to \\infty} f_n(x) \\] then the integral is similarly bounded \\[ \\int_E f\\, d\\mu \\leq \\liminf_{n\\to \\infty} \\int_E f_n\\, d\\mu \\] Apply the dominated convergence theorem (carefully! expand to see details) to \\(g_j = \\inf_{k\\geq j} f_j\\). Proof Define \\(g_n = \\inf_{i\\geq n} f_i\\), then \\(g_n\\) is measurable and \\[ i\\leq j\\implies g_i\\leq g_j, \\quad g_n\\to f \\] Applying the monotone convergence theorem yields \\[ \\int_E g_n\\, d\\mu \\to \\int_E f\\, d\\mu \\] Note that this does not imply equality because the monotone convergence theorem above yields the first equality, and the second inequality may be strict \\[ \\int_E f\\, d\\mu = \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\int_E \\inf_{k\\geq n} f_k\\, d\\mu \\leq \\int_E f\\, d\\mu = \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\inf_{k\\geq n} \\int_E f_k\\, d\\mu \\] There exist examples (see below) where measure is lost through \\(\\inf f_k\\) but not through the \\(\\inf\\) of the integral. Example 4.2 (strict inequality in Fatou's theorem) Let \\(g(x) = (0\\leq x\\leq 1/2)^?0:1\\) and \\[ f_{2k}(x) = g(x), \\quad f_{2k+1} = g(1-x) \\] then \\(\\liminf_{n\\to \\infty} f_n = 0\\) but \\(\\forall n, \\int_0^1 f_n(x)\\, dx = 1/2\\). Theorem 4.8 (Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem) Given measurable sequence \\((f_j)\\to f\\) pointwise and \\(|f_j| \\leq g\\) with \\(g\\) measurable, then \\[ \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\int_E f_n\\, d\\mu = \\int_E f\\, d\\mu \\] As a corollary, \\(L^1\\) is complete under dominated pointwise convergence. Apply Fatou’s theorem to \\(f_n+g\\geq 0\\) and \\(g-f_n\\geq 0\\). Proof First note that \\(f_j, f\\) are integrable since they’re dominated by \\(g\\). By \\(f_n+g\\geq 0\\), invoke Fatou’s theorem \\[ \\int_E (f + g)\\, d\\mu \\leq \\liminf_{n\\to \\infty} \\int_E (f_n+g)\\, d\\mu \\implies \\int_E f\\, d\\mu \\leq \\liminf_{n\\to \\infty} \\int_E f_n\\, d\\mu \\] and pull \\(g\\) out of both sides. Again, by \\(g-f_n\\geq 0\\) see \\[\\begin{align} \\int_E (g - f)\\, d\\mu &amp;\\leq \\liminf_{n\\to \\infty} \\int_E (g - f_n)\\, d\\mu \\\\ -\\int_E f\\, d\\mu &amp;\\leq \\liminf_{n\\to \\infty} \\int_E -f_n\\, d\\mu =-\\limsup_{n\\to \\infty} \\int_E f_n\\, d\\mu \\end{align}\\] Combine the two results to obtain equality \\[ \\limsup_{n\\to \\infty} \\int_E f_n\\, d\\mu \\leq \\int_E f\\, d\\mu \\leq \\liminf_{n\\to \\infty} \\int_E f_n\\, d\\mu \\] Corollary 4.4 (bounded convergence theorem) Given finite-measurable \\(\\mu(E) &lt; \\infty\\) and uniformly bounded convergent sequence \\((f_n)\\to f\\) (i.e. \\(|f_n(x)|\\leq M\\) for all \\(n, x\\)), the dominated convergence theorem applies. Proof: Given finite measure \\(\\mu(E)&lt;\\infty\\), the constant-\\(M\\) function is integrable and dominates \\((f_n)\\). Comparison with Riemann integral Denote the Riemann integral by \\(\\mathcal R\\int_a^b f\\, dx\\). Theorem 4.9 (compatibility with Riemann integral) A function \\(f\\) Riemann integrable on \\([a, b]\\) implies \\(f\\in L^1([a, b])\\) and \\[ \\int_a^b f\\, dx = \\mathcal R \\int_a^b f\\, dx \\] By existence of the Riemann integral, there exists a countable sequence of iteratively refined partitions \\(P_k\\) such that \\[ \\lim_{k\\to \\infty} L(P_k, f) = \\mathcal R \\underline{\\int} f\\, dx, \\quad \\lim_{k\\to \\infty} U(P_k, f) = \\mathcal R \\bar \\int f\\, dx \\] For each partition \\(P_k\\), define functions \\(U_k(x\\in [x_{j-1}, x_j])\\) and \\(L_k\\) to be the sup and inf along the interval, respectively, then in the Lebesgue sense, \\[ L(P_k, f) = \\int L_k\\, dx, \\quad U(P_k, f) = \\int U_k\\, dx \\] the functions are also monotone \\(L_1 \\leq L_2 \\leq \\cdots \\leq f \\leq \\cdots \\leq U_1\\). Let \\(L_k\\to L, U_k\\to U\\), then \\(L, U\\) are bounded measurable functions with \\(L\\leq f\\leq U\\). Then \\[ \\int L\\, dx = \\mathcal R \\underline \\int f\\, dx, \\quad \\int U\\, dx = \\mathcal R \\bar \\int f\\, dx \\] by the monotone convergence theorem. Further note that \\(f\\) is Riemann-integrable iff \\(\\int L\\, dx = \\int U\\, dx\\). This implies \\(L=U\\) a.e. since \\(L\\leq U\\), then \\(L=f=U\\) a.e. and \\(f\\) is measurable; equality with Lebesgue integral follows. Theorem 4.10 (Riemann integrability theorem) Given \\(f\\) bounded on \\([a, b]\\), then the Riemann integral \\(\\mathcal R\\int_a^b f\\, dx\\) exists iff \\(f\\) is continuous a.e. on \\([a, b]\\). Proof: Extending the last proof: for any \\(x\\notin P_k\\) for any \\(k\\), we have \\(U(x)=L(x)\\) iff \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(x\\) (think about this! equivalent to saying that \\(\\sup\\approx \\inf\\) arbitrarily close intervals about \\(x\\)); the union \\(\\bigcup P_k\\) is countable of measure \\(0\\), then \\(f\\) is continuous a.e. iff \\(L=U\\) a.e. iff \\(f\\) is Riemann-integrable on \\([a, b]\\).

Properties of products Recall that the product \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra \\(\\Sigma_1\\times \\Sigma_2\\) is freely generated by measurable rectangles (definition 2.6). Definition 5.1 ((cross) sections) Given sets \\(X, Y\\) and \\(E\\subset X\\times Y\\), define for \\(x\\in X, y\\in Y\\) the sections \\[ [E]_x = \\{y\\in Y: (x, y)\\in E\\}, \\quad [E]^y = \\{x\\in X: (x, y)\\in E\\} \\] The notation should be reminiscent of slicing along \\(X=x\\) on the horizontal, or \\(Y=y\\) on the vertical axis. Similarly, the sections of \\(f\\) defined on \\(X\\times Y\\) is \\[ [f]_x(y) = [f]^y(x) = f(x, y) \\] Proposition 5.1 (sections of measurable sets are measurable) The product \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra \\(\\Sigma = \\Sigma_1\\times \\Sigma_2\\) has the section property that, \\(\\forall A\\in \\Sigma\\), \\[ [A]_{\\forall x\\in \\Omega_1}\\in \\Sigma_2, \\quad [A]^{\\forall y\\in \\Omega_2} \\in \\Sigma_1 \\] Proof The set \\(\\Sigma&#39;\\) of all subsets of \\(\\Omega_1\\times \\Omega_2\\) (regarded as Cartesian product of sets) satisfying the section property is a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra containing \\(\\Sigma_1\\times \\Sigma_2\\) (since sections of the Cartesian product of measurable sets are measurable); the proof concludes by the universal property of \\(\\Sigma_1\\times \\Sigma_2\\), which is the smallest \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra generated by products of measurable sets. Proposition 5.2 (sections of measurable functions are measurable) Given a \\(\\Sigma_1\\times \\Sigma_2\\) measurable function \\(f\\) on \\(\\Omega_1\\times \\Omega_2\\), then \\([f]_{\\forall x\\in \\Omega_1}\\) is a measurable function on \\(\\Omega_2\\), and \\([f]^{\\forall y\\in \\Omega_2}\\) is a measurable function on \\(\\Omega_1\\). Definition 5.2 (product measures) The product of two measure spaces is \\[ (\\Omega_1\\times \\Omega_2, \\Sigma_1\\times \\Sigma_2, \\mu_1\\times \\mu_2) = (\\Omega_1, \\Sigma_1, \\mu_1)\\times (\\Omega_2, \\Sigma_2, \\mu_2) \\] where \\(\\Omega_1\\times \\Omega_2\\) is the Cartesian product of sets, \\(\\Sigma_1\\times \\Sigma_2\\) is the \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra product 2.6, and \\(\\mu_1\\times \\mu_2\\) is uniquely defined by the requirement \\[ \\mu(A_1\\times A_2) = \\mu_1(A_1) \\mu_2(A_2) \\] The exact definition and uniqueness of the product measure is postponed to theorem 5.1.

"],["banachSpaces.html", "6 Spaces of functions Normed spaces, Hahn-Banach Banach theorems Kolmorogorov-Arnold theorem", " 6 Spaces of functions Nontrivialities arise when we generalize from finite-dimensional to infinite-dimensional vector spaces. The theory of normed vector spaces provide the foundation of dual spaces, weak topology, and convex theory; Banach spaces include \\(L^p\\) spaces of integrable functions we will later be working with, so we take time to develop some of their properties. This section, works with \\(\\mathbb F\\) which can be either real or complex. Normed vector spaces, Hahn-Banach: existence of a basis, normed space of linear operators, characterization of continuous linear functionals and operators, graphs, the Hahn-Banach theorem, variational formula of the norm, weak topology and convergence. Banach theorems: Baire’s (category) theorem, open mapping theorem, inverse mapping theorem, principle of uniform boundedness, bounded inverse theorem, closed graph theorem. Key takeaways: A basis in infinite-dimensional vector spaces spans by finite linear combinations, and the dual space (definition 6.4) consists of the set of bounded or, equivalently, continuous linear functionals under the operator norm (definition 6.2); \\(\\mathcal B(V, W)\\) is Banach if \\(W\\) is Banach 6.5. The existence of a basis for infinite-dimensional vector space is is nontrivial and nonconstructive (theorem 6.1). Continuity of linear maps cannot be taken for granted in infinite-dimensional vector spaces. A linear map is continuous iff bounded (theorem 6.2). Every infinite-dimensional normed vector space has a discontinuous linear functional (proposition 6.1). Universal property of the weak topology 6.5. The Hahn-Banach theorem 6.3 can be viewed as an existence result of a minimization problem: what is the minimum norm of the extension of a bounded linear functional to the whole space? Baire’s theorem 6.4: every closed cover of a Banach space contains an element which has nonempty interior. Baire’s theorem leads to the principle of uniform boundedness (corollary 6.1): every family of pointwise bounded linear operators from a Banach space to a normed vector space is uniformly bounded. Completeness (for continuous / bounded linear maps) plays a role similar to compactness (for continuous maps). The closed graph theorem 6.6 is nontrivial since demonstrating continuity needs to show that (1) the limit exists, and (2) the limits are equal; but CGT reduces this to checking the closure of the graph. Normed spaces, Hahn-Banach Definition 6.1 ((Hamel) basis) A subset \\(B\\subset V\\) of a vector space \\(V\\) is a (Hamel) basis if it is linearly independent and every \\(v\\in V\\) can be written as a finite linear combination of elements in \\(V\\). Zorn’s lemma is in fact equivalent to the axiom of choice; it is responsible for the nonconstructive existence result for the basis of infinite-dimensional vector spaces. We will take it for granted. Fun quote from Wikipedia: If you are building a mathematical object in stages and find that (i) you have not finished even after infinitely many stages, and (ii) there seems to be nothing to stop you continuing to build, then Zorn’s lemma may well be able to help you. — William Timothy Gowers Lemma 6.1 (Zorn's lemma) Given a partially ordered set \\(P\\) in which every chain (subset with pairwise comparable elements) has an upper bound in \\(P\\), then \\(P\\) contains at least one maximal element. Theorem 6.1 (existence of basis) Every infinite-dimensional vector space \\(V\\) has a basis. Proof Consider the space \\(A\\subset 2^V\\) of all linearly independent subsets of \\(V\\), partially-ordered by set inclusion. Every chain \\(B_1\\subset B_2\\cdots \\in A\\) is upper-bounded \\(B_j\\nearrow B\\) (which is still linearly independent!), then the maximal element is precisely a basis, else the vector not in the finite linear span could be added to extend the basis. Definition 6.2 ((normed) space of (bounded) linear operators) Given two vector spaces \\(U, V\\), the set of linear operators from \\(U\\) to \\(V\\) is also a vector space, which we denote \\(\\mathcal L(U, V)\\). If \\(U, V\\) are normed, then \\(\\mathcal L(U, V)\\) is equipped with the operator norm \\[ \\|T\\| = \\sup_{\\|f\\in U\\|\\leq 1} \\|Tf\\| \\] The set of bounded linear operators is denoted \\(\\mathcal B(U, V)\\). Definition 6.3 (bounded linear functional) A linear functional on a vector space \\(V\\) is a linear map of signature \\(T:V\\to \\mathbb F\\). It is bounded if \\(\\|T\\|&lt;\\infty\\) using the operator norm. Theorem 6.2 (characterization of continuous linear maps) A linear map \\(T:U\\to V\\) is continuous iff it is bounded. Proof Given \\(T\\) bounded, for every \\(f_j\\to f\\in U\\), we have continuity from \\[ \\|Tf_k - Tf\\| \\leq \\|T\\| \\, \\|f_k - f\\| \\] Conversely, assume \\(T\\) unbounded, then there exists a sequence \\(f_j\\in V\\) with \\(\\|f_j\\|\\leq 1\\) and \\(\\|T f_{k\\to \\infty}\\| \\to \\infty\\). Then \\[ \\lim_{k\\to \\infty} \\dfrac{f_k}{\\|T f_k\\|} = 0, \\quad T\\, \\dfrac{f_k}{\\|T f_k\\|} \\not \\to 0 \\] Theorem 6.2 (characterization of continuous linear functionals) A linear functional \\(\\varphi:U\\to \\mathbb F\\) which is not identally \\(0\\) is continuous iff it is bounded iff: \\(\\ker \\varphi\\) is a closed subspace of \\(V\\). \\(\\overline{\\ker \\varphi} \\neq V\\). Proof Continuity implies (1) since \\(\\ker \\varphi = \\varphi^{-1}(\\{0\\})\\) and continuous maps send closed singletons to closed sets. Conversely, \\(\\varphi\\) unbounded implies \\(\\exists f_j\\in V\\) such that \\(\\|f_j\\|\\leq 1\\) and \\(|\\varphi\\, f_j|&gt;j\\) for each \\(j\\), note that \\[ \\forall j, \\quad \\dfrac{f_1}{\\varphi\\, f_1} - \\dfrac{f_k}{\\varphi\\, f_k} \\in \\ker \\varphi \\] On the other hand, we have \\[ \\lim_{k\\to \\infty} \\dfrac{f_1}{\\varphi\\, f_1} - \\dfrac{f_k}{\\varphi\\, f_k} = \\dfrac{f_1}{\\varphi\\, f_1} \\notin \\ker \\varphi \\] thus \\(\\overline{\\ker \\varphi}\\neq \\ker \\varphi\\) if \\(\\varphi\\) unbounded. Finally prove equivalence with (2), we have (1) implies (2) since \\(V\\) is closed. Conversely, if \\(\\overline{\\ker \\varphi} \\supsetneq \\ker \\varphi\\), we will show that \\(\\overline{\\ker \\varphi} = V\\). To do so, let \\(f\\in \\overline{\\ker \\varphi} - \\ker \\varphi\\), then \\(\\forall g\\in V\\): \\[ g = \\left(g - \\dfrac{\\varphi\\, g}{\\varphi\\, f} f\\right) + \\dfrac{\\varphi\\, g}{\\varphi\\, f} f \\] Recall that \\(\\overline{\\ker \\varphi}\\) is a vector space. The term in the big paranthesis is in \\(\\ker \\varphi\\), and the trailing term is in \\(\\overline{\\ker \\varphi}\\), thus \\(g\\in \\overline{\\ker \\varphi}\\) for every \\(g\\in V\\). Proposition 6.1 Every infinite-dimensional normed vector space has a discontinuous linear functional. Proof: Consider a basis \\(\\{e_j\\in V\\}_{j\\in \\Gamma \\supset \\mathbb N}\\). The linear functional which maps \\(e_j\\) to \\(j\\) is discontinuous. Definition 6.4 (dual space) Given a normed vector space \\(V\\), its dual space \\(V^*\\) consists of the vector space of bounded linear operators under the operator norm (definition 6.2). Definition 6.5 (weak topology, convergence) The weak topology on a normed vector space \\(V\\) is the coarsest topology in which all continuous linear functionals on the space remain continuous. A sequence \\(f_j\\) in a normed vector space \\(V\\) converges weakly to \\(f\\in V\\) if \\(\\alpha\\, x_n\\to \\alpha\\, x\\) for all \\(\\alpha \\in V^*\\). We next proceed to prove the Hahn-Banach theorem. Lemma 6.2 (extension lemma) Given a real normed vector space \\(V\\), a subspace \\(U\\subset V\\), and a bounded linear functional \\(\\psi:U\\to \\mathbb R\\). For every \\(h\\in V-U\\), there exists a linear functional \\(\\varphi:U\\oplus \\mathbb Rh\\to \\mathbb R\\) such that \\(\\varphi_{|U} = \\psi\\) and \\(\\|\\varphi\\| = \\|\\psi\\|\\). Proof idea: write an inequality for the value of \\(\\psi(h)\\). Prove that a valid value exists by triangle inequality and boundedness of \\(\\psi\\). Proof We only need to define \\(\\varphi(h) = c\\in \\mathbb R\\) and figure out a value for \\(c\\) such that \\(\\varphi(f+\\alpha h) = \\psi(f) + \\alpha c\\) satisfies the norm condition. On one hand, \\(\\varphi_{|U} = \\psi\\implies \\|\\varphi\\| \\geq \\|\\psi\\|\\). On the other hand, \\(\\|\\varphi\\| \\leq \\|\\psi\\|\\) requires \\(c\\) to satisfy \\[ |\\psi(f) + \\alpha c| = \\varphi(f) \\leq \\|\\varphi\\| \\|f + \\alpha h\\| \\leq \\|\\psi\\| \\|f + \\alpha h\\|, \\quad \\forall f\\in U, \\alpha \\in \\mathbb R. \\] Without loss of generality we can set \\(\\alpha=1\\) since \\(f\\) is rescalable, requiring \\[ |\\psi(f) + c| \\leq \\|\\psi\\| \\|f + h\\|, \\quad \\forall f\\in U, \\alpha \\in \\mathbb R. \\] Expanding the absolute value \\[ -\\|\\psi\\|\\|f+h\\| - \\psi(f) \\leq c\\leq \\|\\psi\\|\\|f+h\\| - \\psi(f), \\quad \\forall f\\in U \\] The equation will be implied by (in fact, about as strong as, since \\(c\\) must be uniform \\[ \\sup_f \\left[ -\\|\\psi\\|\\|f+h\\| - \\psi(f) \\right] \\leq \\inf_g \\left[ \\|\\psi\\|\\|g+h\\| - \\psi(g) \\right] \\] To prove this, first note the triangle inequality \\(-\\|f+h\\| \\leq \\|g+h\\| - \\|g-f\\|\\), then \\[\\begin{align} -\\|\\psi\\|\\|f+h\\| - \\psi(f) &amp;\\leq \\|\\psi\\|(\\|g+h\\| - \\|g-f\\|) - \\psi(f) \\\\ &amp;\\leq \\|\\psi\\|(\\|g+h\\| - \\|g-f\\|) + \\psi(g-f) - \\psi(g)\\\\ &amp;=\\|\\psi\\|\\|g+h\\| - \\psi(g) + \\left[\\psi(g-f) - \\|\\psi\\|\\|g-f\\|\\right]_{\\leq 0} \\\\ &amp;\\leq \\|\\psi\\| \\|g+h\\| - \\psi(g) \\end{align}\\] Definition 6.6 (graph of a function) Given a function \\(T:V\\to W\\), the graph \\(\\mathrm{graph}(T)\\) of \\(T\\) IS \\[ \\mathrm{graph}(T) = \\{(f, T(f):f\\in V\\}\\subset V\\times W \\] Properties of functions can be read from the graph: \\(T\\) is a linear map iff \\(\\mathrm{graph}(T)\\) is a subspace of \\(V\\times W\\). \\(T:V\\to W\\) is an extension of \\(S:U\\to W\\) iff \\(\\mathrm{graph}(S)\\subset \\mathrm{graph}(T)\\). Given a linear map \\(T:V\\to W\\), then \\(\\|T\\|\\leq c\\) iff \\(\\|g\\| \\leq c\\|f\\|\\) for all \\((f, g) \\in \\mathrm{graph}(T)\\). Theorem 6.3 (Hahn-Banach theorem) Given a normed vector space \\(V\\) with subspace \\(U\\) a bounded linear functional \\(\\psi\\in U^*\\), then there exists \\(\\tilde \\psi\\in V^*\\) with \\(\\|\\tilde \\psi\\|_V = \\|\\psi\\|_U\\) and \\(\\tilde \\psi_{|U} = \\psi\\). Proof We prove the theorem for the real case. Let \\(\\mathcal A\\) be the collection of subsets \\(E\\subset V\\times \\mathbb R\\) satisfying: \\(E=\\mathrm{graph}(\\varphi)\\) for some linear functional \\(\\varphi\\) on some subspace of \\(V\\). \\(\\mathrm{graph}(\\psi)\\subset E\\iff \\varphi\\) is an extension of \\(\\psi\\). \\(\\psi\\) generating \\(E\\) has norm at most \\(\\|\\psi\\|\\). Then \\(\\mathcal A\\) satisfies the hypothesis of Zorn’s lemma 6.1: for every chain of subsets, their union is also in \\(\\mathcal A\\). The extension lemma 6.2 guarantees that the maximal element is the graph of a linear functional defined on all of \\(V\\). The next proposition anticipates the variational formula of the \\(p\\)-norm (proposition 7.6. Proposition 6.2 (variational formula of the norm) Given a normed vector space \\(V\\) and \\(0\\neq f\\in V\\), \\[ \\|f\\| = \\sup_{\\|\\varphi\\|_{V^*} = 1} |\\varphi(f)| \\] In other words, there exists \\(\\varphi\\in V&#39;\\) with \\(\\|\\varphi\\|=1\\) such that \\(\\|f\\| = \\varphi(f)\\). Proof Consider the \\(1\\)-dimensional subspace spanned by \\(f\\), and define \\(\\psi(\\alpha f) = \\alpha \\|f\\|\\), which on this subspace satisfies \\(\\|\\psi\\|=1\\) and \\(\\psi(f)=\\|f\\|\\). Apply the Hahn-Banach extension. Banach theorems Definition 6.7 (completeness, Banach space) A metric space is complete if every Cauchy sequence in the space converges. A Banach space is a complete normed metric space. Proposition 6.3 (connection between complete and closed metric spaces) A complete subset of a metric space is closed, and a closed subset of a complete metric space is complete. Proof Given a complete subset \\(V\\) of a metric space, every convergent sequence is also a convergent Cauchy sequence whose limit stays inside \\(V\\). Given a closed subset, the convergent limit of every Cauchy sequence must say within \\(V\\) by closure property, so \\(V\\) is complete. Recall that to argue for Cauchy convergence we can drop to subsequences (proposition 1.7). Proposition 6.4 (characterization of Banach space) A normed vector space \\(V\\) is complete (i.e. a Banach space) iff \\(\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty g_k\\) converges for every sequence \\(g_j\\in V\\) satisfying \\(\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\|g_k\\|&lt;\\infty\\). Proof Given \\(V\\) complete, the partial sum of \\(g\\) is a Cauchy sequence thus converges. Conversely, given a Cauchy sequence, drop to a subsequence \\(f_j\\) and set \\(f_0=0\\) so that \\[ \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\|f_k - f_{k-1}\\| &lt; \\infty \\] then by assumption \\(\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty (f_k - f_{k-1})=\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} f_n\\) exists. Proposition 6.5 (Banach dual space) \\(\\mathcal B(V, W)\\) is a Banach space (under the operator norm) if \\(W\\) is a Banach space. In particular, the dual space of a Banach space is a Banach space. Proof Given a Cauchy sequence \\(T_j\\in \\mathcal B(V, W)\\), for every function \\(f\\in V\\), the sequence \\(T_j f\\in W\\) is a Cauchy sequence; define \\(T\\, f = T_{j\\to \\infty}\\, f\\). It is linear and bounded, so it remains to show that \\(\\lim_{k\\to \\infty} \\|T_k - T\\| = 0\\). This follows from \\[ \\|(T_j - T)\\, f\\| = \\lim_{k\\to \\infty} \\|T_j f - T_k f\\| \\] Theorem 6.4 (Baire's theorem) Given a Banach space: the intersection of countably many dense open sets is nonempty. if \\(X\\) is the countable union of closed subsets \\(G_1, \\cdots\\), then some \\(G_j\\) contains an open ball. Proof idea: for (1), by denseness construct a Cauchy sequence; argue (2) by contradiction. Proof We prove first prove (1): given a countable sequence of dense open sets \\(U_j\\), we want to show that \\(\\bigcap_{k=1}^\\infty U_k \\neq \\infty\\). Choose \\(f_1\\in U_1\\) and \\(r_1\\in (0, 1)\\) with \\(\\bar B_{r_1}(f_1)\\subset U_1\\) (denoting closure). For each \\(j\\), choose \\(0&lt;r_j&lt;1/j\\), \\(\\bar B_{r_j}(f_j) \\subset U_j\\) and \\(\\bar B_{r_j}(f_j)\\subset \\bar B_{r_{j-1}}(f_{j-1})\\). We can do this because, fixing \\(r_{j-1}, f_{j-1}\\), the ball \\(B_{r_{j-1}}(f_{j-1})\\cap U_j\\) is a nontrivial (by \\(U_j\\) dense) open set, from which we can choose \\(f_j\\) and the radius such that \\(\\bar B_{r_j}(f_j)\\subset U_{j-1}\\). Then \\(f_j\\) is naturally a Cauchy sequence because \\(|f_{j&gt;N} - f_{k&gt;n}| &lt; 1/N\\). By completeness, \\(f_j\\to f\\in X\\), completing the proof of (1). To prove (2) suppose for contradiction that \\(X=\\bigcup G_j\\), each of which has empty interior, then \\(U_j = G_j^c\\) is open and dense; by (1) there exists \\(f\\in \\bigcap (G_j^c) = (\\bigcup G_j)^c\\), contradicting \\(\\bigcup G_j=X\\). Corollary 6.1 (principle of uniform boundedness) Given \\(\\mathcal A\\subset \\mathcal B(V, W)\\) with \\(V\\) Banach and \\(W\\) normed satisfying pointwise boundedness (below), then \\(\\sup_{T\\in \\mathcal A} \\|T\\|&lt;\\infty\\). \\[ \\sup_{T\\in \\mathcal A} \\|Tf\\| &lt; \\infty, \\quad \\text{ for every } f\\in V \\] Proof Given our hypothesis, \\(V_n\\nearrow V\\) with \\[ V_n = \\{f\\in V: \\|T\\, f\\|\\leq n, \\quad \\forall T\\in \\mathcal A\\} \\] Moreover, \\(V_n\\) is closed since each \\(T\\) is continuous. By Baire’s theorem there exists \\(n, h\\in V, r&gt;0\\) with \\(B_r(h)\\subset V_n\\). For any \\(g\\in V\\) with \\(\\|g\\|&lt;1\\), we have \\(rg+h\\in B_r(h)\\subset V_n\\implies \\|T(rg+h)\\|\\leq n\\). \\[ \\|Tg\\| = \\left\\| \\dfrac{T(rg + h)}{r} - \\dfrac{Th}{r} \\right\\| \\leq \\dfrac{\\|T(rg+h)\\|}{r} + \\dfrac{\\|Th\\|}{r} \\leq \\dfrac{n+\\|Th\\|}{r}, \\quad \\forall g\\in V \\] Taking \\(\\sup\\) over all \\(T\\) completes the proof. Theorem 6.5 (open mapping theorem) Given Banach spaces \\(V, W\\), a surjective bounded linear map \\(T:V\\to W\\) is open (i.e.  sends open sets to open sets); note that this does not require \\(T\\) injective, so \\(T\\) is not guaranteed to be a homeomorphism. Proof idea: Show that \\(0\\in \\mathrm{int}\\, T(B(0, 1))\\). Do this by constructing, for each \\(g\\in B(0, 1)\\subset W\\), a bounded \\(f\\in V\\) (which is the limit of a Cauchy sequence) s.t. \\(g=T\\, f\\). Next use linearity to extend to all open balls. Proof Given open \\(U\\subset V\\), we need to show that \\(\\forall f\\in U\\) such that \\(B(f, a)\\subset U\\), there exists \\(b&lt;a\\) such that, by linearity \\[ T\\, B(f, b) = T\\, f + bT(B) \\subset T\\, U \\] It thus suffices to show that \\(\\exists r: B(0, r)\\subset T(B)\\) (i.e. \\(0\\) is an interior point of \\(T(B)\\)). Surjectivity and linearity of \\(T\\) implies that \\[ W = \\bigcup_{k=1}^\\infty T(kB) = \\bigcup_{k=1}^\\infty k T\\, B \\] Apply Baire’s theorem to \\(k \\overline{T\\, B}\\) and use linearity (which respects closure) shows that \\(\\overline{T\\, B}\\) has a nonempty interior; this is where we use the Banach condition on \\(W\\). We need to be especially careful when working with closure and interiors of infinite-dimensional spaces. Given \\(T\\, g_{\\in B}\\in \\mathrm{int}\\, {\\overline{T\\, B}}\\), \\[ 0 \\in \\mathrm{int}\\, \\overline{T\\, (B - g)} \\subset \\mathrm{int} \\, 2\\, \\overline{T\\, B} \\implies \\overline{B(0, \\exists r)} \\subset \\overline{T\\, B} \\] We proceed to show that this implies \\(0\\in \\mathrm{int}(T\\, B)\\); again, this is not a trivial argument. By definition of closure, \\(\\forall h\\in W\\) with \\(\\|h\\|\\leq r\\) we have \\[ \\forall \\epsilon&gt;0, \\exists f\\in B: \\|h - T\\, f\\| &lt; \\epsilon \\] Substitute \\(h\\mapsto rh/\\|h\\|\\) yields, \\(\\forall h\\in W-\\{0\\}, \\epsilon&gt;0\\) \\[ \\exists f\\in \\dfrac{\\|h\\|}{r}B: \\|h - T\\, f\\|&lt;\\epsilon \\tag{6.1} \\] Now pick arbitrary \\(g\\in B\\subset W\\). Apply equation (6.1) with \\((h, \\epsilon)\\mapsto (g, 1/2)\\) to obtain \\[ \\exists f_1\\in B/r: \\|g - T\\, f_1\\|&lt;1/2 \\] Apply equation (6.1) again with \\(h\\mapsto g - T\\, f_1\\in B/2, \\epsilon = 1/4\\) to obtain \\[ \\exists f_2\\in B/2r: \\|g - T\\, f_1 - T\\, f_2\\| &lt; 1/4 \\] Repeat this construction inductively to obtain \\(f_1, f_2, \\cdots \\in V\\) and let \\[ f = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty f_k, \\quad \\|f\\|\\leq \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\|f_k\\| \\leq \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\dfrac 1 {2^{k-1}r} = \\dfrac 2 r \\] Here we used the Banach condition on \\(V\\). By construction, \\(\\|g-T\\, f\\| &lt; 2^{-n}\\) for every \\(n\\), then by continuity of \\(T\\) we have \\(g=T\\, f\\). Thus \\(T\\, B(0, 2 / r)\\subset B(0, 1)\\implies B(0, r / 2)\\subset T\\, B\\). Corollary 6.2 (bounded inverse theorem) Given \\(T\\in \\mathcal B(V, W)\\) injective (so that \\(T^{-1}\\) exists) and surjective, \\(T^{-1}\\) is a bounded linear map \\(W\\to V\\). Given two Banach spaces \\(V, W\\) their vector space product \\(V\\oplus W\\) is a Banach space when equipped with the norm \\(\\|(f, g)\\| = \\max(\\|f\\|, \\|g\\|)\\). This induces the product topology: a product sequence converges iff each component converges. Theorem 6.6 (closed graph theorem) Given Banach spaces \\(V, W\\) and \\(T:V\\to W\\), then \\(T\\) is a bounded linear map iff \\(\\mathrm{graph}(T)\\subset V\\times W\\) is closed. Proof Given \\(T\\) continuous, given \\((f_j, T\\, f_j)\\in \\mathrm{graph}(V\\times W)\\) converging to \\((f, g)\\in V\\times W\\), by the product topology this implies \\((f, T\\, f)\\in \\mathrm{graph}(T)\\), which establishes closure of the grpah. Conversely, given the graph a closed subspace, it is a Banach space (proposition 6.3) with the inherited norm. Consider the bijective projection map \\(\\pi:\\mathrm{graph}(T)\\to V\\) with \\(\\pi(f, T\\, f) = f\\), then \\(\\|\\pi(f, T\\, f)\\|\\leq \\|(f, T\\, f)\\|\\) thus is bounded. Apply the bounded inverse theorem to obtain that \\(\\pi^{-1}(f) = (f, T\\, f)\\) is bounded, implying \\[ \\|T\\, f\\| \\leq \\|(f, T\\, f)\\| = \\|\\pi^{-1}(f)\\| \\leq \\|\\pi^{-1}\\|\\|f\\| \\] Thus \\(\\|T\\| \\leq \\|\\pi\\|^{-1}\\), establishing the boundedness of \\(T\\). Kolmorogorov-Arnold theorem Let \\(\\mathbb I\\) denote the compact interval \\([0, 1]\\) and \\(C(\\mathbb I)\\) the Banach space of continuous functions \\(\\mathbb I\\to \\mathbb R\\) equipped with the supremum norm \\[ \\|f\\| = \\sup_{x\\in [0, 1]} |f(x)| \\] Completeness follows from the completeness of \\(\\mathbb R\\) and uniform continuity on a compact interval. We also equip \\(C(I)^n\\) with the following norm \\[ \\|f\\in C(I)^n\\| = \\max_{j\\in [n]} \\|f_j\\| \\tag{6.2} \\] Lemma 6.3 (rational-distinguishing coefficients) For each \\(n\\in \\mathbb N\\) there exist real numbers \\(\\lambda_1, \\cdots, \\lambda_n\\in \\mathbb R\\) such that for all \\(x_1, \\cdots, x_n, y_1, \\cdots, y_n\\in \\mathbb Q\\), \\[ \\sum_j \\lambda_j x_j = \\sum_j \\lambda_j y_j \\implies x_{\\forall j} = y_j \\] Proof: Choose \\(\\lambda_j\\) to be linearly independent over \\(\\mathbb Q\\). To reduce clutter, given a choice of coefficients \\(\\lambda\\in \\mathbb R^n\\) and embeddings \\(\\phi\\in C(\\mathbb I)^n\\), define the separately-continuous embedding functions \\(\\Phi_j: \\mathbb I^n\\to \\mathbb R\\) by \\[ \\Phi_j(x_1, \\cdots, x_n) = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\lambda_j \\phi_j(x_j) \\tag{6.3} \\] Lemma 6.4 (approximate embeddings are dense open subset) Fixing \\(\\lambda\\) satisfying lemma 6.3 and \\(f\\in C(\\mathbb I^2)\\) with \\(\\|f\\|=1\\), let \\(U_f\\subset C(\\mathbb I)^5\\) consist of tuples \\((\\phi_1, \\cdots, \\phi_5)\\in C(I)^5\\) satisfying \\(\\exists g\\in C(\\mathbb R) \\text{ such that } \\|g\\|\\leq \\dfrac 1 7\\), and \\(\\displaystyle \\forall x, y\\in I^2: \\left| f(x, y) - \\sum_{j=1}^5 (g\\circ \\Phi_j)(x, y) \\right| &lt; \\dfrac 7 8\\), with \\(\\Phi_j\\) defined as in equation (6.3). Then \\(\\forall f\\in C(\\mathbb I^2)\\), the set \\(U_f\\) of embeddings which allow \\(g\\)-approximations of \\(f\\) is a dense open subset of \\(C(\\mathbb I)^5\\). Proof idea: Openness is easy to argue, to open density, fix \\(\\phi^0\\in C(\\mathbb I)^n\\) and Create a atrous redundant tiling \\(R_1, \\cdots, R_{2n+1}\\) of \\(\\mathbb I\\), each covering \\(1/(2n+1)\\) of \\(\\mathbb I\\) with a fine enough resolution. Choose \\(\\epsilon\\)-approximation \\(\\phi_j\\sim \\phi_j^0\\) that is constant rational on each tile \\(R_j\\), distinct on the disconnected pieces of \\(R_j\\), and distinct from any \\(\\phi_{k\\neq j}\\) everywhere on their designated intervals \\(R_j, R_k\\). Fixing \\(f, \\lambda\\), the set \\(U_f\\) is apparantly open since the same \\(g\\) which works for \\((\\phi_j)\\) will also work for a neighborhood of \\((\\phi_j)\\) by continuity. To prove \\(U_f\\) dense, we need to demonstrate: For every \\(\\phi^0_1, \\cdots, \\phi^0_5\\in C(\\mathbb I)^5\\) and \\(\\epsilon&gt;0\\), there exists \\(\\phi_1, \\cdots, \\phi_5\\in U_f\\) such that \\(\\|\\phi - \\phi^0\\|&lt;\\epsilon\\) as in equation (6.2). Fixing a positive integer \\(N\\) (we’ll specify it later), for each \\(j\\in \\{1, \\cdots, 5\\}\\) we can consider the set of all intervals \\[ R_j = \\bigcup_{s=0}^{N-1} \\left[\\dfrac s N, \\dfrac{s+1}{N}\\right] 1_{s\\neq j-1\\mod 5}, \\quad j\\in \\{1, \\cdots, 5\\} \\] Let \\(R_{jk}\\) denote the almost-disjoint subintervals in the union, we call each \\(R_{jk}\\) the \\(k\\)-th red interval of rank \\(j\\). The following properties are satisfied: Each \\(R_j\\) covers at most \\(4/5\\), and each \\(R_{jk}\\) covers \\(4/N\\) of \\(\\mathbb I\\). Almost every \\(x\\in \\mathbb I\\) is contained in at most \\(3\\) of the subintervals \\(R_{jk}\\) for distinct \\(j\\)’s. Fixing \\(\\phi^0\\in C(\\mathbb I)^5\\) and \\(\\epsilon&gt;0\\), there clearly exists \\(N\\) large enough such that there exists \\(\\phi \\in C(\\mathbb I)^5\\) satisfying: \\(\\|\\phi - \\phi^0\\| &lt; \\epsilon\\). each \\(\\phi_j\\) constant and equal to a rational number on each \\(R_{jk}\\). Follows from the arbitrariness of \\(N\\), uniform continuity of \\(\\phi_j^0\\), and the density of \\(\\mathbb Q\\subset \\mathbb R\\). \\(\\phi_j(R_{jk})\\neq \\phi_j(R_{jl})\\) for \\(k\\neq l\\). \\(\\phi_j(x) \\neq \\phi_k(z)\\) for all \\(x\\in R_j, z\\in R_k\\). In spirit, each \\(\\phi_j\\) is responsible for approximating \\(\\phi_j^0\\) on \\(R_j\\) and is unconstrained elsewhere. Next define the red rectangles \\(r_{jk}\\) of rank \\(j\\) to be the disconnected components of \\(R_j\\times R_j\\subset \\mathbb I^2\\). The distance between any two points in one \\(R_{jk}\\) is \\(\\leq \\sqrt{2\\cdot (4/N)^2} = \\sqrt{32}/N\\).

Main results: Jensen’s inequality (theorem 7.1): generalizalized property of convexity w.r.t. integration. \\(L^p\\) space is a Banach space that consists of equivalence classes of a.e. equal functions.

Minkowski’s inequality (theorem 7.2) states the convexity of the \\(L_p\\) norm and holds for \\(1\\leq p\\leq \\infty\\). Young and Holder’s inequality are the main tools for applying convexity. Young’s inequality does not hold for \\(p=1, \\infty\\). Holder’s inequality hold for \\(p\\in [1, \\infty]\\) although saturation conditions for \\(p=1, \\infty\\) does not come from pointwise saturation of Young’s inequality. Fatou’s lemma 4.2 is a great tool for demonstrating \\(p\\)-norm convergence using pointwise convergence. Convexity Definition 7.1 (convex set and function) A convex set \\(K\\subset \\mathbb R^n\\) is closed under \\((x, y)\\mapsto \\lambda x + \\bar y\\) for all \\(\\lambda \\in [0, 1]\\). A convex function on a convex set \\(K\\) is a real-valued function satisfying \\[ f(\\lambda x + \\bar \\lambda y) \\leq \\lambda f(x) + \\bar \\lambda f(y) \\] the function \\(f\\) is strictly convex at \\(x\\) if the inequality is strict for all \\(y\\). Proposition 7.1 If \\(K\\) is an open set, then a convex function on \\(K\\) is continuous. Definition 7.2 (support plane) The support plane to a graph of \\(f:K\\to \\mathbb R\\) at \\(x\\in K\\subset \\mathbb R^n\\) is a plane in \\(\\mathbb R^{n+1}\\) that touches \\((x, f(x))\\) and that nowhere lies above the graph; if the support plane at \\(x\\) is unique, then it is the tangent plane. For example, there is no unique support plane at \\(x=0\\) for \\(|x|\\). For convex \\(f\\), the existence of a tangent plane is equivalent to differentiability. In particular, the tangent plane for \\(y=f(x)\\) at \\(x_0\\) has expression \\[ y - f(x_0) = \\nabla f(x_0) \\cdot (y - x) \\] Thus for general convex functions, for each \\(x\\) there exists a vector \\(V\\in \\mathbb R^n\\) such that \\[ f(y) \\geq f(x) + V\\cdot (y - x) \\tag{7.1} \\] Definition 7.3 (Hölder conjugate) The Hölder conjugate of \\(p&gt;1\\) is given by the equation \\[ p^{-1} + q^{-1} = 1 \\] We also denote \\(q=\\bar p\\). It is oftentimes more convenient to note that \\[ p = \\dfrac q {q - 1} \\iff q = \\dfrac p {p - 1} \\] Proposition 7.2 (Young's inequality) Given Hölder conjugates \\(p, q&gt;1\\), \\[ ab \\leq \\dfrac{a^p}{p} + \\dfrac{b^q}{q}, \\quad \\forall a, b\\geq 0 \\] Equality is saturated when \\(a^p = b^q\\). Proof Consider the convex function \\(f(a) = \\dfrac{a^p}{p}\\). Its Legendre transform is \\[\\begin{align} g(b) &amp;= \\sup_a \\left(ab - \\dfrac{a^p}{p}\\right) = a_*b - \\dfrac{a_*^p}{p},\\quad a_* = b^{1/(p-1)} \\\\ &amp;= b^{1 + 1/(p-1)} - \\dfrac 1 p b^{p/(p-1)} = b^q - \\dfrac 1 p b^q = \\dfrac{b^q}{q} \\end{align}\\] Young’s inequality follows from the variational characterization of the Legendre transform. Equality is saturated when \\(a=b^{1/(p-1)} \\iff a^p = b^q\\). Definition 7.4 (average of a measurable function) Assuming \\(\\mu(\\Omega)\\) is finite, the expectation (average) of a measurable function \\(f:\\Omega\\to \\mathbb R\\) is defined as \\[ \\langle f\\rangle= \\dfrac 1 {\\mu(\\Omega)} \\int_\\Omega f\\, d\\mu \\] Theorem 7.1 (Jensen's inequality) Given a convex function \\(J:\\mathbb R\\to \\mathbb R\\) and measurable \\(f:\\Omega\\to \\mathbb R\\) with \\(\\mu(\\Omega)&lt;\\infty\\), then The negative part \\((J\\circ f)_-\\) is in \\(L^1(\\Omega)\\) (recall the decomposition \\(f=f_+ - f_-\\). \\(\\langle J\\circ f\\rangle\\geq J(\\langle f\\rangle)\\); when \\(J\\) is strictly convex at \\(\\langle f\\rangle\\), there is equality iff \\(f\\) is constant. Proof idea: integrate the supporting vector equation (7.1). Proof Fixing \\(\\langle f\\rangle\\), there exists a constant \\(V\\in \\mathbb R\\) such that \\[ J(\\forall t)\\geq J(\\langle f\\rangle) + V(t - \\langle f\\rangle) \\tag{7.2} \\] This bounds the negative component (but not the positive one!) \\[ [J\\circ f]_-(x) \\leq |J(\\langle f\\rangle)| + |V||\\langle f\\rangle| + |V| |f(x)| \\] using \\(\\mu(\\Omega)&lt;\\infty\\), this bounded function is integrable. To obtain (2), integrate (7.2) for all \\(t=f(x)\\) \\[ \\langle J \\circ f\\rangle\\geq J(\\langle f\\rangle) - V \\langle f\\rangle+ V\\langle f\\rangle \\] with \\(J\\) strictly convex, the inequality is saturated when \\(\\langle J\\circ f\\rangle= J(\\langle f\\rangle)\\). \\(L^p\\) as a Banach space Definition 7.5 (Lp space, norm) Given a positive (nonnegative) measure \\(\\mu\\) and \\(1\\leq p&lt;\\infty\\), the space \\(L^p(\\Omega, d\\mu)\\) is the space of complex-valued functions \\(f:\\Omega\\to \\mathbb C\\) such that: \\(f\\) is \\(\\mu\\)-measurable. \\(|f|^p\\) is \\(\\mu\\)-integrable. The measure \\(d\\mu\\) is usually omitted if understood. Given \\(f\\in L^p(\\Omega)\\), its norm is \\[ \\|f\\|_p = \\left[\\int_\\Omega |f(x)|^p \\mu(dx)\\right]^{1/p} \\] This definition is extended to \\(L^\\infty(\\Omega, d\\mu)\\) as the space of \\(\\mu\\)-a.e. bounded functions, with \\[ \\|f\\|_\\infty = \\inf \\{ K: \\mu(\\{x\\in \\Omega: |f(x)|&gt;k\\}) = 0 \\} \\] The \\(\\infty\\)-norm is also called the essential supremum of \\(|f|\\). Proposition 7.3 (normed vector space) \\(L^p(\\Omega, d\\mu)\\) is a vector space, and the \\(L^p\\) norm satisfies for \\(1\\leq p\\leq \\infty\\): Linearity: \\(\\|\\lambda f\\|_p = |\\lambda| \\|f\\|_p\\). Nonnegativity: \\(\\|f\\|_p\\geq 0\\) with equality iff \\(f=0\\) for \\(\\mu\\)-a.e. Triangle inequality: \\(\\|f+g\\|_p \\leq \\|f_p\\| + \\|g\\|_p\\). Proof Vector space properties: closure under scalar multiplication is apparant. Closure under addition follows from the convexity of \\(|x|^p\\). \\[ \\left\\|\\dfrac{\\alpha + \\beta}{2}\\right\\|^p \\leq \\dfrac{|\\alpha|^p + |\\beta|^p}{2} \\] which follows from the convexity of \\(|x|^p\\). Norm properties: linearity follows from definition. For nonnegativity, \\(\\|f\\|_p = 0 \\iff \\|f^p\\|_1 = 0 \\iff f=0\\), where the second and third equalities are to be understood as \\(\\mu\\)-a.e. Triangle inequality is proved by Minkowski’s inequality 7.2. Proposition 7.4 (Hölder's inequality) Given measurable \\(f, g\\) on \\((\\Omega, \\Sigma, \\mu)\\) and \\(p\\in [1, \\infty]\\) \\[ \\|fg\\|_1 \\leq \\|f\\|_p \\|g\\|_{\\bar p} \\] Proof idea: normalize \\(f, g\\), then apply Young’s inequality. Proof The cases \\(p=1\\) or \\(\\infty\\) is straightforward, so consider \\(p&gt;1\\). Consider the nontrivial case where \\(0&lt; \\|f\\|_p, \\|g\\|_{\\bar p} &lt; \\infty\\). First assume \\(\\|f||_p = \\|g\\|_{\\bar p}=1\\), then using Young’s inequality (proposition 7.2): \\[\\begin{align} \\int |fg|\\, d\\mu &amp;\\leq \\int \\dfrac 1 p |f|^p + \\dfrac 1 {\\bar p} \\|g\\|^{\\bar p}\\, d\\mu = \\dfrac 1 {p} + \\dfrac 1 {\\bar p} = 1 \\end{align}\\] This completes the proof in the special case; for unnormalized \\(f, g\\), apply the homogeneity of the norms. Proposition 7.5 If \\(\\mu(\\Omega)&lt;\\infty\\), then for \\(0&lt;p&lt;q&lt;\\infty\\), we have \\[ \\|f\\|_p \\leq \\mu(\\Omega)^{(q-p)/pq} \\|f\\|_q \\] and \\(L^q \\subset L^p\\). Proof Apply Holder’s inequality to \\(r=q/p&gt;1\\): \\[\\begin{align} \\|f\\|_p^p &amp;= \\||f|^p\\|_1 \\leq \\| |f|^p\\|_{q/p} \\|1\\|_{\\overline{q/p}} = \\|f\\|_q^p \\mu(\\Omega)^{(q-p)/q} \\\\ \\|f\\|_p &amp;\\leq \\mu(\\Omega)^{(q-p)/pq} \\|f\\|_q \\end{align}\\] Proposition 7.6 (variational formula for p-norm) Given \\(1\\leq p&lt;\\infty\\) and \\(f\\in L^p\\) \\[ \\|f\\|_p = \\sup_{\\|g\\|_{\\bar p} \\leq 1} \\|fg\\|_1 \\] This holds for \\(p=\\infty\\) assuming \\(\\sigma\\)-finite \\(\\mu\\). Proof If \\(\\|f\\|_p=0\\) then both sides are zero trivially. The \\(p=1\\) case holds trivially, so first consider \\(1 &lt; p &lt; \\infty\\), One side of Holder’s inequality gives \\[ \\left|\\int fg\\, d\\mu \\right| \\leq \\|fg\\|_1 \\leq \\|f\\|_p \\] To prove the other direction, one can choose \\(\\|g\\|\\) which saturates the inequality above by (1) matching the sign of \\(f\\) and (2) saturate Young’s inequality by \\(g(x)^{\\bar p} = f(x)^p\\). Note how the converse breaks down for \\(p=\\infty\\), in which case Holder’s inequality is not implied by Young’s. Remark (counterexample). For \\(p=\\infty\\), consider the non \\(\\sigma\\)-finite measure on \\(X=\\{b\\}\\) with \\(\\mu(\\emptyset)=0, \\mu(\\{b\\})=\\infty\\). Then \\(L^1=\\{0\\}\\). For the constant function \\(f=1\\), we have \\(\\|f\\|_\\infty = 1\\) (recall definition 7.5 carefully). Theorem 7.2 (Minkowski's inequality) Given \\(1\\leq p \\leq \\infty\\) and \\(f, g\\in L^p\\), \\(\\|f+g\\|_p \\leq \\|f\\|_p + \\|g\\|_p\\). Proof For arbitrary \\(h\\in L^{\\bar p}\\) with \\(\\|h\\|_{\\bar p}\\leq 1\\), we have \\[ \\left|\\int (f+g) h\\, d\\mu \\right| \\leq (\\|f\\|_p + \\|g\\|_p) \\|h\\|_{\\bar p} \\leq \\|f\\|_p + \\|g\\|_p \\] Take supremum over \\(h\\) and invoke the variational formula (proposition 7.6) to obtain the desired result. Proposition 7.7 (Lp is a Banach space) Every Cauchy sequence in \\(L^p\\) converges. Drop to a subsequence, use Minkowski’s inequality to argue absolute convergence, next use Fatou’s lemma to establish convergence in \\(p\\)-norm from a.e pointwise convergence. Proof First consider \\(1\\leq p&lt;\\infty\\). By proposition 1.7, without loss of generality drop to a subsequence \\(f_j\\) (which can be defined inductively using the Cauchy condition) and define \\(f_0=0\\) such that \\[ \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\|f_k - f_{k-1}\\|_p &lt; \\infty \\] Conditions for the dominated convergence theorem: we aim to show the integrability of \\[ g_m = \\sum_{k=1}^m |f_k - f_{k-1}| \\to g \\in L^p \\] note that \\(g_m &lt; g\\). This follows by Minkowski’s inequality (theorem 7.2) and the definition of our subsequence we have \\[ \\|g\\|_p^p = \\int |g|^p\\, d\\mu = \\lim_{m\\to \\infty} |g_m|^p\\, d\\mu \\] The second equality uses the monotone convergence theorem 4.7. Next define the partial sum \\[ f_m = \\sum_{k=1}^m f_k - f_{k-1} \\] We have \\(|f_m| \\leq g_m\\), the absolute convergent sequence \\(g_m(x)\\) (for a.e. \\(x\\)) also implies the convergence of \\(f_m(x)\\to f(x)\\) a.e. Then \\(|f(x)|\\leq g(x)\\implies f\\in L^p\\). Finally, use Fatou’s lemma 4.2 to demonstrate convergence in \\(p\\)-norm: \\[\\begin{align} \\|f_k - f\\|_p = \\left( \\int |f_k - f|^p\\, d\\mu \\right) \\leq \\liminf_{j\\to \\infty} \\left( \\int |f_k - f_j|^p\\, d\\mu \\right) = \\liminf_{j\\to \\infty} \\|f_k - f_j\\|_p \\end{align}\\] Duality Recall that the dual space \\((L^p)^*\\) consists of bounded linear operators on \\(L^p\\) and is a Banach space. We will show that \\((L^p)^*\\) under the operator norm is equivalent to \\(L^{\\bar p}\\) under the \\(\\bar p\\)-norm. Also recall the weak topology and convergence 6.5. Theorem 7.3 (Riesz representation theorem) The dual space of \\((L^p)\\) for \\(1&lt; p &lt; \\infty\\) is \\(L^{\\bar p}\\); every linear functional \\(L\\in L^p(\\Omega)^*\\) has the form, for some unique \\(v\\in L^{\\bar p}\\), \\[ L(g) = \\int_\\Omega v(x)g(x)\\, d\\mu \\] This is true for \\(p=1\\) if \\((\\Omega, \\Sigma, \\mu)\\) is \\(\\sigma\\)-finite. The identification \\((L^p)^* \\cong L^{\\bar p}\\) is further norm-preserving: \\[ \\|L\\| = \\|v\\|_q \\] "],["Fourier.html", "8 Fourier Analysis Compact domain: \\(\\partial D\\) The Haar measure The dual group, Fourier transform", " 8 Fourier Analysis Organization: Fourier transform on a compact domain: the Poisson kernel, the continuous limit of the Poisson integral, orthonormal basis of \\(L^2\\), convergence conditions of the Fourier series, convolution and its norm properties. Haar measure: locally compact abelian groups and the construction of the Haar measure. Key takeaways: The Fourier series of a continuous function may fail to converge even on a compact domain, but the following results hold: Strong convergence is guaranteed for twice continuously differentiable functions (proposition 8.6); the main idea here is to bound each term in the series using the derivative relation of Fourier coefficients. An Abel-sum like correction \\(\\mathcal P_{0\\leq r&lt;1} f\\) (definition 8.3) corresponds to the Poisson integral, leading leading naturally to the definition 8.4 of the Poisson kernel, a disc version of the Dirac delta. The Poisson integral converges uniformly in the \\(L^\\infty\\) norm to any continuous function (proposition 8.4). It converges in the \\(L^{1\\leq p&lt;\\infty}\\) norm to any \\(L^p\\) function (proposition 8.10). The Fourier basis is an orthonormal basis of \\(L^2(\\partial D)\\) (proposition 8.7), so every \\(L^2\\) function is the \\(L^2\\)-limit of its Fourier series. This holds by the special Hilbert space structure of \\(L^2\\). The definition of sums and a basis becomes nuanced in possibly uncountable-dimensional vector spaces (definition 8.7). Convolution is initially defined in \\(L^1\\) and satisfies a crucial norm property (proposition 8.8). The central convolution-multiplication duality 8.9 relies on a translation-invariant measure and the ability to exchange integrals. Strengths of the topologies: convergence in \\(L_p\\) norm, pointwise convergence a.e, etc. Compact domain: \\(\\partial D\\) Let \\(D=\\{z\\in \\mathbb C: |z|&lt;1\\}\\) denote the open unit disk in the complex plane and \\(\\partial D\\) its boundary consisting of unit-norm complex numbers. Definition 8.1 (measurable subsets) Let \\(\\sigma\\) be the measure on \\(\\partial E\\) induced by the Lebesgue measure on \\((-\\pi, \\pi]\\) normalized so that \\(\\sigma(\\partial D)=1\\). \\(E\\subset \\partial D\\) is measurable if \\(\\{t\\in (-\\pi, \\pi]: e^{it}\\in E\\}\\) is a Borel subset. \\(\\sigma(E) = \\mu(\\{t\\in (-\\pi, \\pi]: e^{it}\\in E\\})/2\\pi\\).

Proposition 8.1 (orthonormal family) \\(\\{z^n\\}_{n\\in \\mathbb Z}\\) is an orthonormal family in \\(L^2(\\partial D)\\). Note that, for \\(z\\in \\partial D\\), we have \\(\\bar z = 1/z\\).

Lemma 8.1 (Riemann-Lebesgue lemma) For every \\(f\\in L^1(\\partial D)\\), we have \\(\\lim_{n\\to \\pm \\infty} \\hat f(n)=0\\).

Proof Property (1) follows from definition; property (2) follows from integrating the integral representation and noting that \\(\\forall n\\in \\mathbb Z - \\{0\\}\\), we have \\(\\int_{\\partial D} \\xi^{n}\\, d\\sigma(\\xi)=0\\). To show (3), by properties (1), (2) it suffices to show that \\[ \\lim_{r\\to 1^-} \\int_{|1-\\xi|\\geq \\delta} P_r(\\xi)\\, d\\sigma(\\xi) = 0 \\] Consider the denominator \\(|1-r\\xi|^2\\) in the Poisson kernel: for \\(|1-\\xi|\\geq \\delta\\) and \\(1-r&lt;\\delta/2\\), we have \\[\\begin{align} |1-r\\xi| &amp;= |1-\\xi - (r-1)\\xi| \\\\ &amp;\\geq |1-\\xi| - |r-1| |\\xi| \\\\ &amp;\\geq \\delta - \\delta/2 = \\delta/2 \\end{align}\\] Thus the denominator is uniformly (w.r.t. \\(r\\)) bounded away from \\(0\\) while the numerator approaches \\(0\\). Convergence results Proposition 8.4 (continuous limit of the Poisson integral) If \\(f\\) is continuous, then \\(\\lim_{r\\to 1^-} \\|f - \\mathcal P_r f\\|_\\infty = 0\\). In other words, \\(\\mathcal P_r f\\) converges uniformly to \\(f\\). Proof \\(f\\) is uniformly continuous in \\(\\partial D\\), and apply the approximate identity properties of \\(P_r\\) above. This does not contradict the fact that the Fourier series of some continuous functions in \\(L^1(\\partial D)\\) diverge: in these cases, the \\(\\lim_{r\\to 1^-}\\) cannot be exchanged with the series sum. Definition 8.5 (differentiation) Given \\(f:\\partial D\\to \\mathbb C\\), we define \\(f^{[k]}\\) to be the \\(k\\)-th derivative \\(\\tilde f^{(k)}\\) of \\(f\\) in the chart \\([-\\pi, \\pi)\\) with periodic boundary conditions, then expressed back in the \\(\\partial D\\subset \\mathbb C\\) chart. Proposition 8.5 (Fourier coefficients of derivatives) Given \\(k\\in \\mathbb N\\) and \\(f:\\partial D\\to \\mathbb C\\) being \\(k\\)-times continuously differentiable, then \\[ \\widehat{f^{[k]}}(n) = (in)^k \\hat f(n) \\] Proof For \\(n=0\\), the integral vanishes due to periodic boundary conditions: \\[ \\widehat{f^{[k]}}(0) = \\dfrac 1 {2\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi \\tilde f^{(k)}(t) \\, dt = \\tilde f^{(k-1})(t) \\big|_{-\\pi}^\\pi \\] Next choose \\(n\\neq 0\\) and apply integration by parts \\[\\begin{align} \\widehat{f^{[k]}}(n) &amp;= \\dfrac 1 {2\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi \\tilde f^{(k)}(t)e^{-int} \\, dt \\\\ &amp;= \\dfrac 1 {2\\pi} f^{(k-1)}(t) e^{-int} \\big|_{-\\pi}^\\pi + \\dfrac{in} {2\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi \\tilde f^{(k-1)}(t) e^{-int}\\, dt \\\\ &amp;= in \\widehat{f^{[k-1]}}(n) \\end{align}\\] Proposition 8.6 (convergence of twice continuously differentiable functions) Given \\(f:\\partial \\mathbb C\\) twice continuously differentiable, then the following sum converges uniformly \\[ f(\\forall z\\in \\partial D) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty \\hat f(n) z^n \\] Proof Proposition 8.5 implies that \\[ |\\hat f(n\\neq 0)| = \\dfrac{|\\hat f(n)|}{n^2} \\leq \\dfrac{\\|f^{[2]}\\|_1}{n^2} \\] The inequality follows from \\(|z^n|\\leq 1\\) on \\(\\partial D|\\) and Cauchy-Schwarz. Applying the dominated convergence theorem to the sum proves that the partial sums converge continuously (thus uniformly continuously) on \\(\\partial D\\). Convolution and \\(L^p\\) An orthonormal family \\(\\{e_k\\in V\\}_{k\\in \\Gamma}\\) in a Hilbert space (complete inner product space) satisfies \\(\\langle e_j, e_k\\rangle= \\delta_{jk}\\); note that \\(\\Gamma\\) may be uncountable! Also recall the following: Definition 8.6 (unordered sum) Given an unordered index set \\(\\Gamma\\) and \\(\\{f_k\\in V\\}_{k\\in \\Gamma}\\), where \\(V\\) is a normed vector space, the sum \\(\\sum_{k\\in \\Gamma}f_k\\) is said to converge if there exists \\(g\\in V\\) such that \\(\\forall \\epsilon&gt;0\\), there exists a finite subset \\(\\Omega\\subset \\Gamma\\) such that \\[ \\left\\|g - \\sum_{j\\in \\Omega&#39;} f_j \\right\\| &lt; \\epsilon \\] for all finite \\(\\Omega&#39;\\) such that \\(\\Omega\\subset \\Omega&#39; \\subset \\Gamma\\). Definition 8.7 (orthonormal basis) An orthonormal family \\(\\{e_k\\}_{k\\in \\Gamma}\\) is an orthonormal basis of \\(V\\) if every element in \\(V\\) has a decomposition \\[ f = \\sum_{k\\in \\Gamma} \\langle f, e_k\\rangle e_k, \\quad \\sum_{k\\in \\Gamma} |\\langle f, e_k\\rangle|^2 &lt; \\infty \\] Proposition 8.7 (orthonormal Fourier basis) The Fourier basis \\(\\{z^n\\}_{n\\in \\mathbb Z}\\) is an orthonormal basis of \\(L^2(\\partial D)\\). Using an approximation by twice continuously-differentiable functions, show that \\(f\\) not in the span satisfies \\(\\|f\\|_2=0\\), which implies \\(f=0\\). Then the span is maximal by the orthogonal decomposition. Proof Consider \\(f\\) not in the span of \\(\\{z^n\\}\\), we have \\(\\langle f, z^n\\rangle= 0\\). Next fix \\(\\epsilon&gt;0\\) and choose a twice continuously differentiable function (dense in \\(L^2\\) by approximating step functions) \\(g\\) such that \\(\\|f - g\\|_2 &lt; \\epsilon\\); note that \\[\\begin{align} \\|g\\|_2^2 &amp;= \\sum_{n\\in \\mathbb Z} |\\hat g(n)|^2 = \\sum_{n\\in \\mathbb Z} |\\widehat{(g-f)}(n)|^2 \\leq \\|g-f\\|_2^2 \\end{align}\\] The second equation holds by \\(\\hat f(n)=0\\). Then \\(\\|f\\|_2 \\leq \\|f-g\\|_2 + \\|g_2\\| \\leq 2\\|f-g\\|_2 = 2\\epsilon\\). Corollary 8.1 (convergence in L2) Given \\(f\\in L^2(\\partial D)\\), the Fourier series converges to \\(f\\) in the norm of \\(L^2(\\partial D)\\). Definition 8.8 (convolution on the disc) Given \\(f, g\\in L^1(\\partial D)\\), their convolution \\(f\\ast g\\) is \\[ (f\\ast g)(z) = \\int_{\\partial D} f(w) g(z\\bar w)\\, d\\sigma(w) \\] for those \\(z\\) for which the integral makes sense. Proposition 8.8 (norm property of convolution) Given \\(f\\in L^1(\\partial D)\\) and \\(g\\in L^{1\\leq p\\leq \\infty}(\\partial D)\\), we have \\[ \\|f\\ast g\\|_p \\leq \\|f\\|_1 \\|g\\|_p \\] Proof First derive the following inequality for \\(\\|h\\|_{\\bar p}\\leq 1\\): distribute \\(|\\cdot|\\), apply Tonelli, then apply Holder’s inequality. \\[\\begin{align} \\|(f\\ast g)h\\|_1 &amp;= \\int_{\\partial D} \\left|\\int_{\\partial D} f(w) g(z\\bar w)\\, d\\sigma(w)\\, h(z)\\right|\\, d\\sigma(z) \\\\ &amp;\\leq \\int_{\\partial D} |f(w)| \\int_{\\partial D} |h(z) g(z\\bar w)|\\, d\\sigma(z) \\, d\\sigma(w) \\\\ &amp;\\leq \\|h\\|_{\\bar p} \\|g\\|_p \\int_{\\partial D} |f(w)|\\, d\\sigma(w) \\leq \\|g\\|_p \\|f\\|_1 \\end{align}\\] Next recall the variational \\(p\\)-norm formula (proposition 7.6) with suitable generalizations to edge cases to obtain \\[ \\|f\\ast g\\|_p = \\sup_{\\|h\\in L^{\\bar p}(\\partial D)\\|_{\\bar p} = 1} \\int_{\\partial D} |(f\\ast g) h|\\, d\\sigma \\] Take \\(\\sup_h\\) to obtain the desired bound. As corollaries of the following proposition, we obtain the commutativity and associativity of convolution. Proposition 8.9 (convolution-multiplication duality) Given \\(f, g\\in L^1(\\partial D)\\) we have \\[ \\widehat{(f\\ast g)}(n) = \\hat f(n)\\hat g(n) \\] Proof First note that, by rotation invariance of the measure (generalized by the Haar measure), substitute \\(z\\bar w=\\xi\\iff z=\\xi w\\) to obtain \\[\\begin{align} \\int_{\\partial D} g(z\\bar w) \\overline{z^n}\\, d\\sigma(z) = \\int_{\\partial D} g(\\xi) \\overline{\\xi^n w^n}\\, d\\sigma(\\xi) = \\bar w^n \\hat g(n) \\end{align}\\] Next expand the definitions, apply Fubini, then recombine the integral to obtain \\[\\begin{align} \\widehat{(f\\ast g)}(n) &amp;= \\int_{\\partial D} (f\\ast g)(z)\\overline{z^n}\\, d\\sigma(z) \\\\ &amp;= \\int_{\\partial D} \\bar z^n \\int_{\\partial D} f(w)g(z\\bar w)\\, d\\sigma(w)\\, d\\sigma(z) \\\\ &amp;= \\int_{\\partial D} f(w) \\int_{\\partial D} g(z\\bar w)\\bar z^n\\, d\\sigma(z)\\, d\\sigma(w) \\\\ &amp;= \\hat g(n) \\int_{\\partial D} f(w) \\bar w^n \\, d\\sigma(w) = \\hat f(n)\\hat g(n) \\end{align}\\] Proposition 8.10 (convergence of the Poisson integral) Given \\(f\\in L^p(\\partial D)\\) for \\(1\\leq p&lt;\\infty\\) \\[ \\lim_{r\\to 1^-} \\|f - \\mathcal P_r f\\|_p = 0 \\] Proof Let \\(g:\\mathcal D\\to \\mathbb C\\) be a continuous function with \\(\\|f-g\\|_p &lt; \\epsilon\\). By proposition 8.4, there exists \\(R\\in [0, 1)\\) such that \\(\\|g - \\mathcal P_{\\forall r\\in (R, 1)} g\\|_\\infty &lt; \\epsilon\\). Noting that \\(\\mathcal P_r f = P_r \\ast f\\), \\(\\|P_r\\|_1\\leq 1\\), and proposition 8.8: \\[\\begin{align} \\|f - \\mathcal P_r f\\|_p &amp;\\leq \\|f-g\\|_p + \\|g - \\mathcal P_r g\\|_p + \\|\\mathcal P_r g - \\mathcal P_r f\\|_p \\\\ &amp;&lt; \\epsilon + \\|g - \\mathcal P_r g\\|_\\infty + \\|P_r\\ast (g-f)\\|_p \\\\ &amp;&lt;2\\epsilon + \\|P_r\\|_1 \\|g-f\\|_p &lt; 3\\epsilon \\end{align}\\] The Haar measure The dual group, Fourier transform "],["bibliography.html", "Bibliography", " Bibliography "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
