# Preface {-}
These notes accompany the Fall 2024 iteration of Math 114, a second-semester 
undergraduate course on real analysis and measure theory. The notes 
deviate quite a bit from lecture materials, in particular: 

1. I prefer a more principled construction of the Lebesgue measure as the restriction of 
    the exterior measure using the Carathéodory theorem.
    - Sets declared measurable by the Carathéodory criteria are automatically 
    closed under $\sigma$-algebra operations, so 
    one only needs to show the measurability of rectangles 
    to establish the measurability of the Borel sets.
2. Materials are heavily supplemented by Sheldon Axler's 
    _Measure, Integration and Real Analysis_. 

These notes are organized as follows:

1. Abstract machinery of [measures and $\sigma$-algebra](#abstractMachinery). 
    - Lieb and Loss, _Analysis_ (2nd ed), chapter 1. 
2. The [exterior measure and Lebesgue measure](#realMeasures) on $\R^n$. 
    - John K. Hunter, [_Measure theory_](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~hunter/measure_theory/measure_notes_ch2.pdf)
        chapter 2. 
3. [Measurable functions, Lebesgue's theory of integration, and Fubini](#integration). 
    - Rudin, _Principles of Real Analysis_, chapter 11; 
    Axler, chapter 2; Lieb and Loss, chapter 1. 
4. $L^p$ spaces. 
    - Lieb and Loss, chapter 2; Axler, chapter 7. 


Course agenda: 

1. Basic elements of measure theory: Lebesgue integration. 
2. $L^p$-spaces, which are constructions which internalize Lebesgue integration. 
3. Fourier analysis, Hilbert spaces. 
4. Radon-Nikadym theorem and Hölder spaces, which are constructions 
    internalizing the RN-theorem and differentiation. 

Nontrivial results: 

1. Monotone class theorem \@ref(thm:monotoneClassTheorem): 
    freely-generated monotone class equals freely-generated $\sigma$-algebra 
    for algebra of sets containing $\Omega$. 
    - Techniques for use (example theorem \@ref(thm:uniqueMeasure)): 
    rewrite nested chain as disjoint union, then pass through the limit 
    using the countable additivity of measures. 
    Next apply the reduction from finite to $\sigma$-finite measures. 
2. Carathéodory measurability theorem \@ref(thm:measureConstruction): 
    given an outer measure $\mu$, the measurable sets $B\subset \Omega$ satisfying 
    $\mu(\forall E) = \mu(E\cap B) + \mu(E\cap B^c)$ form a $\sigma$-algebra 
    and obey countable additivity.
