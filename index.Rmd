# Preface {-}
These notes accompany the Fall 2024 iteration of Math 114, a second-semester 
undergraduate course on real analysis and measure theory. The notes 
deviate quite a bit from lecture materials, in particular: 

1. I prefer a more principled construction of the Lebesgue measure as the restriction of 
    the exterior measure using the Carathéodory theorem.
    - Sets declared measurable by the Carathéodory criteria are automatically 
    closed under $\sigma$-algebra operations, so 
    one only needs to show the measurability of rectangles 
    to establish the measurability of the Borel sets.
2. Materials are heavily supplemented by Sheldon Axler's 
    _Measure, Integration and Real Analysis_. 

## Organization {-}

1. Abstract machinery of [measures and $\sigma$-algebra](#abstractMachinery). 
    - Lieb and Loss, chapter 1. 
2. The [exterior measure and Lebesgue measure](#realMeasures) on $\R^n$. 
    - Hunter. 
3. [Lebesgue integral](#integration), 
    Littlewood's three principles, and integral convergence theorems. 
    - Rudin, , chapter 11; Axler, chapter 2; Lieb and Loss, chapter 1. 
4. [Iterated integrals](#iteratedIntegrals}): uniqueness of product measure 
    and Fubini's theorem. 
    - Lieb and Loss, chapter 1. 
5. [$L^p$ spaces](#Lpspaces). 
    - Lieb and Loss, chapter 2; Axler, chapter 7.

## Main deliverables {-}

1. <u>Monotone class theorem</u> \@ref(thm:monotoneClassTheorem): 
    freely-generated monotone class equals freely-generated $\sigma$-algebra 
    for algebra of sets containing $\Omega$. 
2. <u>Carathéodory's theorem</u> \@ref(thm:measureConstruction): 
    given an outer measure $\mu$, the measurable sets $B\subset \Omega$ satisfying 
    $\mu(\forall E) = \mu(E\cap B) + \mu(E\cap B^c)$ form a $\sigma$-algebra 
    and obey countable additivity. 
3. <u>Dominated convergence theorem</u>:  
4. <u>Fubini's theorem</u>

Proof techniques:

1. Using the monotone class theorem (example theorem \@ref(thm:uniqueMeasure)): 
    rewrite nested chain as disjoint union, then pass through the limit 
    using the countable additivity of measures. 
    Next apply the reduction from finite to $\sigma$-finite measures. 
2. Working with countable collection of approximations: given tolerance $\epsilon$, 
    introduce approximation of index $j$ with tolerance $\epsilon 2^{-j}$ 
    to have additively bounded total tolerance. 
    - Examples: outer measure properties of 
    exterior measure (proposition \@ref(prp:extOuterMeasure)). 
3. Prove properties for characteristic functions, then generalize them 
    using approximation and limit theorems [here](#realIntegration). 
    - Examples: Luzin's theorem, 
    monotone convergence theorem \@ref(thm:monotoneConvergence),   
4. Sandwich bounds 
    - Lemma \@ref(lem:caratheodoryAdditive), 
    Monotone convergence theorem.
